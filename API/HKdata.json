      "title": "India\u2019s early election results point to rebuke for Modi and his party",
      "news": "NEW DELHI \u2014 Indian voters appeared to deliver an unexpected repudiation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s leadership as early vote tallies on Tuesday showed tepid support for his Hindu nationalist party, piercing the air of invincibility around the most dominant Indian politician in decades. The votes counted so far show that the Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party will likely fall short of a majority on its own and need its allies to form the government.\n\nThe party\u2019s performance was projected to fall short of its showing in 2014, when Modi swept to power on a wave of national anger over corruption, or 2019, when he was buoyed by nationalist sentiment over a border clash with Pakistan.\n\nSuch a result would be a rare setback for an Indian politician who has never failed to secure a majority in state or national elections over a 23-year political career and cultivated an image as a popular strongman and a serial winner. Most analysts expected him to easily brush aside India\u2019s enervated and poorly funded opposition parties, some of which had their bank accounts frozen and their leaders jailed by the government in the run-up to the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the mood shifted dramatically as early vote counts trickled in Tuesday morning and indicated that the BJP might not single-handedly secure the 272 seats needed in the 543-member Lok Sabha lower house, as it comfortably managed in 2014 and 2019.\n\nPolitical analysts began to wonder whether Modi would need to negotiate with his allies and make concessions to form a government. In a rare move, television networks typically aligned with the BJP changed the photo accompanying the party logo from Modi to the party president, J.P. Nadda.\n\nIndian stocks dropped 6 percent on fears that the pro-business BJP might fall short, and companies led by Gautam Adani, a billionaire seen as a Modi ally, saw as much as a fifth of their value wiped out within hours.\n\nFor the first time in years, Modi seemed vulnerable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe entire party structure is built around advertising around him, but the challenge this time was that they weren\u2019t able to come up with a set of issues that they could tie around Modi,\u201d said Nilanjan Sircar, a political scientist at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. The government \u201coverreached,\u201d Sircar said. \u201cPeople were uncomfortable with some of what the government was doing. Some red lines were crossed.\u201d\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Modi and his allies exuded supreme confidence, with BJP leaders pledging to capture 400 seats and staking the campaign almost solely on Modi\u2019s personal appeal.\n\nModi\u2019s name appeared 67 times in the BJP\u2019s campaign manifesto, overshadowing the perennial issues of \u201cinflation\u201d and \u201cjobs\u201d mentioned once and twice, respectively. Many government welfare programs, such as free bags of grain, were marketed as \u201cModi\u2019s Guarantee.\u201d In campaign materials, the BJP featured pictures of Modi being welcomed by world leaders such as President Biden, who has sought to cultivate ties with the Indian leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as the campaign unfolded, bitter recriminations over India\u2019s religious and caste divides, often fanned by Modi himself, overshadowed discussions about his accomplishments, including improving India\u2019s infrastructure, introducing pro-business policies or uplifting its international image.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi drew criticism for his comments at an election rally on April 21 in Rajasthan, India. (Video: Reuters)\n\nIn some of the most memorable moments of the campaign, Modi told a television interviewer that he was chosen by God. He repeatedly warned lower-caste Hindus at rallies that only he could stop the rival Congress party from scrapping India\u2019s affirmative action programs or snatching their livestock and wedding jewelry and redistributing them to Muslims.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIn the end, it was voters in the devout Hindu heartland, the BJP stronghold that propelled Modi to victory in 2014 and 2019, who appeared to be pulling back their support. The Congress and Samajwadi opposition parties were set to capture more than half of the seats in Uttar Pradesh, the same state where Modi had consecrated a grand Hindu temple with fanfare in February, early results showed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere, results also seemed to show a dissatisfaction with the status quo.\n\nIn restive Kashmir, voters in Baramulla voted in Sheikh Abdul Rashid, an independent candidate who ran from jail. In Manipur, which has witnessed a year of ethnic fighting, Congress looked set to win seats over the BJP.\n\nThe results could cast doubt over Modi\u2019s ability to push through the rest of his agenda. BJP officials had proposed streamlining elections by conducting state assembly polls on the same day as the national election and carry out redistricting.\n\nModi had also signaled that if given a strong mandate for a third term, he could push forward with contentious labor reforms that would make hiring and firing workers easier, help local business owners and invite foreign investment.\n\nHis ability to set the agenda is now stymied, said Rahul Verma, a political fellow at the Center for Policy Research. \u201cThere will be more pressure points. Institutions might show more autonomy. There might be more criticism of the government,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that for the first time, global audiences and leaders will see a Modi who may have \u201ccome to power with great difficulty, not with ease.\u201d\n\nDuring the election campaign, there were signs that the BJP confidence has produced a degree of complacency among its supporters. In the BJP stronghold of Madhya Pradesh Saurabh Singal, a BJP supporter, said this time around he wasn\u2019t going to bother traveling the over a hundred miles to his hometown to cast a vote since it would be a \u201clandslide victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis year, it is clear who is going to win,\u201d he had said the day before polling in early May.\n\nOn Tuesday, BJP supporters who had milled around the party headquarters in Delhi expecting raucous celebrations with DJs as in previous years began to stream out early.\n\nSome party members put on a brave face and argued that a competitive election was a good thing after all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHey, in some areas, we will grow, and in some, we will decrease,\u201d said Rekha Singh, a member of the BJP women\u2019s wing. \u201cIf we were running alone in a country, where would the fun be?\u201d\n\nAcross town, Congress supporters held something far closer to a celebration. Muslim men from nearby states flocked to Delhi to watch the results on lawn chairs. Nearby, Hindu women flashed their mangalsutras \u2014 the traditional Hindu wedding necklace that Modi had warned would be redistributed to Muslims \u2014 to photographers in a mockery of his rhetoric.\n\n\u201cI am a devout Hindu who follows all customs and rituals laid down in my religion,\u201d Nikita Chaturvedi said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t need any political party to save my religion. I am wearing my mangalsutra. Mr. Modi cannot take it away.\u201d\n\nLater in the evening, at the headquarters, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said, to the sounds of drumbeats and packed crowds, that the results were an indictment of Modi.",

      "title": "India lost the manufacturing race to China. Here's why it could still succeed",
      "news": "India lost the manufacturing race to China. Here's why it could still succeed\n\ntoggle caption Mike Hutchings/AFP via Getty Images\n\nToday is India\u2019s election day. Well, technically, it\u2019s the day that the official results from India's election are expected to be announced. Voting has been going on for the past six weeks. It apparently takes a long time for 900 million voters to cast their ballots.\n\nThe economy is a top concern for Indian voters. And, if they were to compare their economy\u2019s long-run trajectory to their neighbor to the northeast \u2014 China \u2014 they might have a lot to complain about.\n\nBack in 1980, India and China were roughly equal when it came to earning money. Both nations\u2019 GDP per capita \u2014 or, more casually speaking, their average income per resident \u2014 was around $300 per year.\n\nIn the decades since 1980, however, the fortunes of the Chinese have rocketed dramatically ahead of the Indians. The average Chinese resident now makes over $13,000 per year. The average Indian resident makes only about $2,700. China\u2019s economy, in other words, has grown almost five times faster than India\u2019s.\n\nThe core reason for China\u2019s economic success: manufacturing. China now produces around 35 percent of the world\u2019s manufactured goods. Manufacturing has also been central to the economic success of virtually every other nation that has gone from rags to riches.\n\nIndia has lagged far behind in manufacturing. Despite representing almost 18 percent of the entire world\u2019s population, India produces only around 2 to 3 percent of the world\u2019s manufactured goods. That number has barely budged since the 1980s.\n\nSo it makes sense that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is widely expected to be elected to a third term today, has made manufacturing a centerpiece of his development strategy for India. The Modi administration has been protecting and subsidizing strategic manufacturing sectors, like textiles and electronics, to the tune of billions of dollars per year.\n\nThis is all wrong, argues Raghuram Rajan. And he\u2019s not just some random dude. Rajan is the former head of the Central Bank of India, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, and now a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Together with Rohit Lamba, he has a new book out titled Breaking the Mold: India's Untraveled Path to Prosperity.\n\nWe at Planet Money recently spoke with Rajan about India's challenges and opportunities to become rich, why the manufacturing-led road that China paved may not be open to India, and the route that Rajan believes India should take instead.\n\n\n\nThe Ticking Clock For Indian Economic Development\n\nWhile India\u2019s economy has fallen dramatically behind China\u2019s in recent decades, it\u2019s been looking better recently. India\u2019s GDP is projected to grow over 6.5% this year. That\u2019s more than double the United States and many other rich countries. Companies like Apple have been shifting production to India. Under the Modi government, the country has seen an explosion of investment in infrastructure, like roads, railways, and ports. The stock market is booming. And it looks like India is steadily marching to soon become the third largest economy in the world.\n\nHowever, Rajan expresses a lot of concern about India\u2019s economy. Sure, he says, it may be growing fast compared to many rich countries. But, he says, it needs to grow much, much faster to have any chance of eradicating the extreme poverty and joblessness that plagues the world\u2019s most populous country (over 1.4 billion people!)\n\nWhen Rajan looks at the Indian economy, he sees a ticking clock. India, he says, is currently experiencing what social scientists call \u201cthe demographic dividend.\u201d It has a lot of young people entering the workforce and relatively few old people. This Goldilocks period for growth, Rajan predicts, will only last about 25 years in India. After that, the country\u2019s population will skew older, fewer people will work, and more people will require government assistance to meet their needs. The economy will predictably slow down (as seems to be the case with an aging China recently).\n\n\u201cSo the question is: what level of growth does India need over the next 25 years to become rich before it becomes old?\u201d Rajan says. \u201cAnd the answer is much higher than 6.5 percent. If you look at China in the early 2000s, it was growing at 10, 12, 14 percent.\u201d\n\nRajan argues that India is squandering the gleaming opportunity of its demographic dividend. Despite having this huge economic advantage of an abundance of young people, \u201cthese young kids coming into the labor force are not finding jobs,\u201d Rajan says. Lacking good job opportunities, some of the brightest graduates of India\u2019s elite engineering schools tend to migrate abroad. The current government\u2019s strategy of trying to retrace China and many other countries\u2019 manufacturing-led path to greater riches, Rajan argues, is not working.\n\nThe big reason why: manufacturing has become much more competitive. When earlier developers, like China, entered the marketplace, they were competing against \u201ccostly Western labor,\u201d Rajan says. That gave them a big competitive advantage: cheap labor.\n\n\u201cToday, when India enters, it's not competing with Western countries, it is competing with Bangladesh, Vietnam, and still China,\u201d Rajan says. That means India has much less room to make globs of money in manufacturing.\n\nIf not manufacturing, then what?\n\nWhile India\u2019s manufacturing sector has limped along, it\u2019s doing increasingly well in services. For those of us who have dealt with customer service or IT departments of major American corporations, you\u2019re probably familiar with dealing with someone based in India on the telephone. However, India specializes in higher skilled services as well. Rajan says companies like Boeing, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan have been increasingly turning to Indians to do high-skill services. \u201cJP Morgan, for example, has 3,000 lawyers in India, making contracts for the rest of JP Morgan's functions across the world,\u201d Rajan says.\n\nEven when it comes to physical products, like the iPhone, the money tends to be services, like design and marketing. \u201cApple hasn\u2019t manufactured anything since 2004,\u201d Rajan says. It outsources its manufacturing to the company Foxconn. Apple is worth nearly $3 trillion. Foxconn is worth only about $80 billion.\n\nWith the explosion of remote work since the pandemic, Rajan believes the outsourcing of services to India can be supercharged. To borrow from his book's title, Rajan now believes India can break from the cookie-cutter mold of manufacturing-led development and leapfrog into service sectors that have tended to be dominated by the workers of rich countries. He imagines Indians providing many more services to Westerners and others around the world, in areas such as telemedicine, design, consulting, even Yoga instruction.\n\nTo achieve this vision, Rajan believes India needs to shift strategies \u201cfrom brawn to brain.\u201d Right now, the country is pursuing industrial policies like pouring billions of taxpayer subsidies into manufacturing. But, Rajan argues, they should be more flexible and open-minded about the country\u2019s development path.\n\nThe money currently being poured into building up manufacturing, Rajan argues, would be better spent on improving poorly funded public schools, building world-class universities, and training workers to thrive in the growing services sector. Indian leaders should also, he says, create a more business-friendly regulatory environment and invest in social programs like childcare, which would allow more Indians to enter the workforce.\n\nIndia may have \u201cmissed the manufacturing bus,\u201d but, Rajan says, it can still grow rich by jumping on the services train. Sure, we haven\u2019t really seen any poor country leapfrog like this before. But Rajan believes India is well-suited to do it. It\u2019s got a massive population of English speakers. The Internet has enabled more services to be done remotely. And Indian service providers are willing to work for much less than their Western counterparts.\n\nAnd India is still a democracy. Sure, Rajan says, there\u2019s a strong case to be made that China\u2019s undemocratic authoritarianism may have actually helped it squash opposition and strong-arm its way to becoming a manufacturing powerhouse. But, he argues, democracy is an asset for India going forward because, he argues, democracy keeps leaders accountable and political freedom empowers citizens to buck orthodoxies, challenge the establishment, and be more creative and innovative. He is concerned that, under Prime Minister Modi, India has taken a more authoritarian turn.\n\nIn a future Planet Money newsletter, we will dive deeper into the question of whether democracy is an asset or a liability for economic growth.

      "title": "India\u2019s popular but polarizing leader Narendra Modi is extending his decade in power. Who is he?",
      "news": "NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who claimed victory for his alliance in an election seen as a referendum on his decade in power, is a popular but polarizing leader who has presided over a fast-growing economy while advancing Hindu nationalism.\n\nModi, 73, is only the second Indian prime minister to win a third straight term.\n\nHis Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party failed to secure a majority on its own \u2014 as it did in 2014 and 2019 \u2014 after facing a stronger than expected challenge from the opposition. But together with other parties in his National Democratic Alliance, his bloc won enough seats for a slim parliamentary majority and to form his third consecutive government, Election Commission data showed Tuesday.\n\nTo supporters, Modi is a larger-than-life figure who has improved India\u2019s standing in the world, helped make its economy the world\u2019s fifth-largest, and streamlined the country\u2019s vast welfare program, which serves around 60% of the population. To some, he may even be more than human.\n\nBut to critics, he\u2019s a cult leader who has eroded India\u2019s democracy and advanced divisive politics targeting the Muslims who make up 14% of the country\u2019s population. They say he has also increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent.\n\nModi\u2019s government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nPolitical analysts say Modi\u2019s victory was driven by social welfare programs that provided benefits from food to housing, and the strident Hindu nationalism that has consolidated a majority of Hindu votes for his party. Hindus make up 80% of India\u2019s population.\n\nThe economy is growing by 7% and more than 500 million Indians have opened bank accounts during Modi\u2019s tenure, but that growth hasn\u2019t created enough jobs, and inequality has worsened under his rule, according to some economists.\n\nModi began his election campaign two months ago by promising to turn India into a developed country by 2047 and focused on highlighting his administration\u2019s welfare policies and a robust digital infrastructure that have benefited millions of Indians.\n\nBut as the campaign progressed, he increasingly resorted to anti-Muslim rhetoric, calling them \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and making references to a Hindu nationalist claim that Muslims were overtaking the Hindu population by having more children. Modi also accused the opposition of pandering to the minority community.\n\nConspicous piety has long been a centerpiece of Modi\u2019s brand, but he\u2019s also begun suggesting that he was chosen by God.\n\nIn a TV interview during the campaign, he said \u201cWhen my mother was alive, I used to believe that I was born biologically. After she passed away, upon reflecting on all my experiences, I was convinced that God had sent me.\u201d\n\nIn January, he delivered on a longstanding Hindu nationalist ambition by leading the opening of a controversial temple on the site of a razed mosque.\n\nAfter campaigning ended last week, Modi went to a Hindu spiritual site for a televised 45-hour meditation retreat. Most Indian TV channels spent hours showing the event.\n\nBorn in 1950 to a lower-caste family in western Gujarat state, as a young boy Modi joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a paramilitary, right-wing group which has long been accused of stoking hatred against Muslims. RSS is the ideological parent of Modi\u2019s BJP.\n\nThe tea seller\u2019s son got his first big political break in 2001, becoming chief minister of his home state of Gujarat. A few months in, anti-Muslim riots ripped through the region, killing at least 1,000 people. There were suspicions that Modi quietly supported the riots, but he has denied the allegations.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi\u2019s visa, citing concerns that he did not act to stop the communal violence. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.\n\nThirteen years later, Modi led his Hindu nationalist party to a spectacular victory in the 2014 national elections after promising sweeping reforms to jumpstart India\u2019s flagging economy.\n\nBut Modi\u2019s critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country\u2019s minorities, especially Muslims.\n\nMonths after securing a second term in 2019, his government revoked the special status of disputed Kashmir, the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state, and split it into two federally governed territories. His government passed a law that grants citizenship to religious minorities from Muslim countries in the region but excludes Muslims.\n\nDecision like these have made Modi hugely popular among his diehard supporters who hail him as the champion of the Hindu majority and see India emerging as a Hindu majoritarian state.\n\nModi has spent his political life capitalizing on religious tensions for political gain, said Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scientist and expert on Modi and the Hindu right. During his time as a state leader, he pioneered a embrace of Hindu nationalism unlike anything seen before in Indian politics.\n\n\u201cThat style has remained. It was invented in Gujarat and today it is a national brand,\u201d Jaffrelot said.",

      "news": "Highlights from India\u2019s election results: Catch up on AP\u2019s coverage as results were tallied.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared victory Tuesday for his alliance in India\u2019s general election, claiming a mandate to push forward with his agenda, even though his party lost seats to a stronger than expected opposition, which pushed back against his mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s victory is the victory of the world\u2019s largest democracy,\u201d Modi told the crowd at his party\u2019s headquarters, saying Indian voters had \u201cshown immense faith\u201d both in his party and his National Democratic Alliance coalition.\n\nModi\u2019s win was only the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country\u2019s first prime minister. But also, for the first time since his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it did not secure a majority on its own, meaning he will need the support of other parties in his coalition \u2014 a stunning blow for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory.\n\nThe party may now be \u201cheavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nMore than 640 million votes were cast in the marathon election held over a span of six weeks in the world\u2019s largest democratic exercise.\n\nIn the face of the surprising drop in the BJP\u2019s support, the opposition claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a \u201cmoral and political loss\u201d for Modi.\n\n\u201cThis is public\u2019s victory and a win for democracy,\u201d Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nDespite the setback, Modi pledged to make good on his election promise to turn India\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s third biggest, from its current fifth place, and not shirk with pushing forward with his agenda.\n\nHe said he would advance India\u2019s defense production, boost jobs for youth, raise exports and help farmers, among other things.\n\n\u201cThis country will see a new chapter of big decisions. This is Modi\u2019s guarantee,\u201d he said, speaking in the third person.\n\nMany of the Hindu nationalist policies he\u2019s instituted over the last 10 years will also remain locked in place.\n\nCongress party supporters cheer as they follow proceedings of vote counting at their party headquarters in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, June 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Altaf Qadri)\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years.\n\nAfter winning a record 303 seats in 2019, the BJP appeared unlikely to win more than 240, far short of the 272 needed to form a majority government on its own, with 224 seats won and the lead in 16 constituencies and counting ongoing.\n\nModi\u2019s NDA coalition, meantime, was on track to win a combined 286-seat majority, with 263 seats won and leads in 23 races.\n\nThe opposition INDIA coalition appeared as if it would win 230 seats.\n\nFinal figures were not expected until Wednesday, with counting going late into the night. But congratulations for Modi from leaders of regional countries including neighboring Nepal and Bhutan flowed in, while the White House commended India for its \u201cvibrant democratic process.\u201d\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India\u2019s political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India\u2019s standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance while the economy, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India\u2019s vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\u201cPeople are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\u201d Payal said. \u201cThis is a big deal for us. If we don\u2019t wake up now, when will we?\u201d\n\nRahul Gandhi, the main face of the opposition Congress party, said he saw the election numbers as a message from the people.\n\n\u201cThe poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,\u201d he told a news conference.\n\nModi\u2019s popularity has outstripped that of his party\u2019s during his first two terms in office, and he turned the parliamentary election into one that more resembled a presidential-style campaign, with the BJP relying on the leader\u2019s brand.\n\n\u201cModi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\u201d said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nUnder Modi\u2019s government, critics say India\u2019s democracy has come under increasing strain with strong-arm tactics used to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nEconomic discontent has also simmered under Modi. While stock markets have reached record-highs, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \u201cModi\u2019s guarantees,\u201d highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With Modi at the helm, \u201cIndia will become a developed nation by 2047,\u201d he repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\n\u201cThese issues have resonated and made a dent,\u201d added Aiyar, the public policy scholar.",

      "title": "India\u2019s election concludes with the votes being counted Tuesday. Here\u2019s what to know",
      "news": "NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 The world\u2019s largest election could also be one of its most consequential.\n\nIndia has close to 970 million voters among its more than 1.4 billion people, and its general election pits Prime Minister Narendra Modi, an avowed Hindu nationalist, against a broad alliance of opposition parties that are struggling to play catch up.\n\nNow 73, Modi first swept to power in 2014 on promises of economic development, presenting himself as an outsider cracking down on corruption. Since then, he has fused religion with politics in a formula that has attracted wide support from the country\u2019s majority Hindu population.\n\nIndia under Modi is a rising global power, but his rule has also been marked by rising unemployment, attacks by Hindu nationalists against minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media.\n\nHOW DOES THE ELECTION WORK?\n\nThe final day of voting in the six-week-long election was Saturday. The vote counting began Tuesday with updates expected throughout the day. The election results will likely be known the same day.\n\nThe voters are choosing 543 members for the lower house of Parliament for a five-year term.\n\nVotes were cast at more than a million polling stations. Each of the seven voting phases lasted a single day with several constituencies across multiple states voting that day. The staggered polling allowed the government to transport election officials and voting machines and deploy tens of thousands of troops to prevent violence. Candidates crisscrossed the country, poll workers hiked to remote villages, and voters lined up for hours in sweltering heat.\n\nIndia has a first-past-the-post multiparty electoral system in which the candidate who receives the most votes wins. To secure a majority, a party or coalition must breach the mark of 272 seats.\n\nIndia uses electronic voting machines.\n\nWHO IS RUNNING?\n\nModi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party and his main challenger, Rahul Gandhi of the Indian National Congress, represent Parliament\u2019s two largest factions. Several other important regional parties are part of an opposition bloc.\n\nOpposition parties, which previously were fractured, have united under a front called INDIA, or Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, to deny Modi a third-straight election victory.\n\nThe alliance has fielded a single main candidate in most constituencies. But it has been roiled by ideological differences and personality clashes, and has not yet decided on its candidate for prime minister.\n\nMost exit polls project Modi is set to extend his decade in power with a third consecutive term, especially after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city in January, which fulfilled his party\u2019s long-held Hindu nationalist pledge. During the polls, Modi escalated polarizing rhetoric in incendiary speeches that targeted the country\u2019s Muslim minority.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country\u2019s most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP clinched an absolute majority by sweeping 303 parliamentary seats. The Congress party managed only 52 seats.\n\nWHAT ARE THE BIG ISSUES?\n\nFor decades, India has clung doggedly to its democratic convictions, largely due to free elections, an independent judiciary, a thriving media, strong opposition and peaceful transition of power. Some of these credentials have eroded under Modi\u2019s 10-year rule, with the polls seen as a test for the country\u2019s democratic values.\n\nMany watchdogs have now categorized India as a \u201chybrid regime\u201d that is neither a full democracy nor a full autocracy.\n\nThe poll results will also test Modi\u2019s limits. Critics accuse him of running on a Hindu-first platform, endangering the country\u2019s secular roots.\n\nUnder Modi, the media, once viewed as vibrant and largely independent, have become more pliant and critical voices muzzled. Courts have largely bent to Modi\u2019s will and given favorable verdicts in crucial cases. Centralization of executive power has strained India\u2019s federalism. And federal agencies have bogged down top opposition leaders in corruption cases, which they deny.\n\nAnother key issue is India\u2019s large economy, which is among the fastest growing in the world. It has helped India emerge as a global power and a counterweight to China. But even as India\u2019s growth soars by some measures, the Modi government has struggled to generate enough jobs for young Indians, and instead has relied on welfare programs like free food and housing to woo voters.",

      "title": "Modi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority",
      "news": "(Bloomberg) -- Narendra Modi vowed to continue as India\u2019s prime minister even after his party lost its majority in parliament, forcing him to rely on allies to form a government for the first time since he stormed to power a decade ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nModi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party was leading in 240 seats, short of the 272 needed for a majority, while his National Democratic Alliance had 293 seats \u2014 enough to form a government if it sticks together. The opposition bloc, known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, was on course to win 229 seats, the results showed.\n\nModi claimed victory for his coalition in a post on X, calling it a \u201chistorical feat\u201d and vowing to \u201cmove forward with new energy, new enthusiasm and new resolve.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday is auspicious,\u201d Modi told cheering supporters at his party\u2019s headquarters later on Tuesday night. \u201cIt is confirmed that NDA has won a mandate to form the government for a third straight term. We are very, very grateful to the people who have reposed full faith in the BJP and NDA.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s stocks had their worst day in more than four years, as it became clear the election outcome would be much closer than expected. Markets had hit a record high on Monday after exit polls released over the weekend showed Modi would coast to an easy victory in the marathon, six-week election. Before voting kicked off on April 19, the prime minister had boldly predicted that his alliance would win a whopping 400 seats.\n\n\u201cThis is not an election \u2014 it is a kind of political earthquake,\u201d said Niranjan Sahoo, senior fellow with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation who has written several books on Indian politics. \u201cEven if Modi becomes the prime minister, his position will be diminished to a great extent. He will not be the same Modi.\u201d\n\nIndia Election Results 2024 \u2014 Follow Live Results\n\nModi now needs to secure the support of two key members of his broader National Democratic Alliance who control some 30 seats \u2014 enough to flip the balance of power in parliament. Leaders of those two parties have a history of switching sides, and only joined up with Modi a few months ago, making it unclear whether they will stick with him or back the opposition bloc. A spokesperson of the allies, the Telugu Desam Party in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, affirmed support for Modi\u2019s coalition.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore than 20 opposition parties, spearheaded by Rahul Gandhi, formed a united front in a bid to stop Modi\u2019s once-dominant electoral machine. A mixture of regional and caste-based groups, the alliance focused on appealing to voters who felt left out of India\u2019s growth story, which has been marked by growing inequality, pervasive joblessness and rising living costs.\n\nAfter the results became clear, Gandhi said the election showed that voters don\u2019t want Modi to run the country. The opposition alliance would meet on Wednesday to discuss next steps, he added.\n\n\u201cWe do not like the way they have run this country for the last 10 years,\u201d Gandhi told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThat is a huge message to Mr. Narendra Modi.\u201d\n\nThe result is a stunning disappointment for the 73-year-old leader, who has been the main face of the BJP\u2019s election campaign and built the party primarily around himself. Besides raising questions about Modi\u2019s own future as prime minister, a weak coalition government will likely make it difficult for him to push through tough economic reforms or further his Hindu nationalist agenda assuming he returns to power.\n\nThe lackluster performance marks the first major setback at national polls for Modi. He had looked unbeatable heading into the election, backed by one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies and the fulfillment of key promises appealing to India\u2019s Hindu majority, including the building of a temple on the site where a 500-year-old mosque had been torn down.\n\nSigns of trouble for Modi emerged after the first of seven rounds of voting. A dip in turnout triggered a broad get-out-the-vote effort that saw Modi adopt a more strident tone, firing up his Hindu nationalist base with divisive anti-Muslim rhetoric and attacks on the opposition\u2019s welfare policies.\n\nModi had appealed to India\u2019s 1.4 billion people with a combination of business-friendly policies, welfare measures for the poor and Hindu nationalist policies. He had pledged more of the same in his third term, vowing measures to create jobs while also replacing India\u2019s religion-based marriage and inheritance laws with a uniform civil code \u2014 a measure that Muslims, Christians and other minorities oppose because it would prevent them from adhering to some faith-based laws.\n\nThose more contentious proposals may now be off the table. The results also call into question whether Modi would have the political capital to implement contentious changes to land and labor laws, as well as a slew of other reform measures needed to achieve his goal of turning India into a developed nation by mid-century.\n\nEven with a reduced mandate or a change in government, India\u2019s growth trajectory should largely remain positive. Business leaders from Elon Musk to Jamie Dimon have hailed India\u2019s potential as an alternative to China, with some economists projecting that the nation\u2019s $3.5 trillion economy can become the largest contributor to global growth within the next five years.\n\n\u201cAs far as economic policy is concerned, fiscal backsliding I think is a risk,\u201d said Shumita Sharma Deveshwar, senior director of India Research at Global Data.TS Lombard. \u201cApart from that I actually don\u2019t see much of a change in terms of reform policies. Even with a strong majority, Modi was unable to implement much of the so-called big bang reforms.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Debjit Chakraborty, Akriti Sharma, Shruti Srivastava, Menaka Doshi, Rakesh Sharma and Preeti Soni.\n\n(Updates with Modi comments in fourth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "title": "India 2024 election results show Prime Minister Narendra Modi winning third term, but with a smaller mandate",
      "news": "New Delhi \u2014 India's 2024 election results show Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to win his third term in office, with the political alliance led by his Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) on track to win a solid majority of the seats up for grabs in India's Parliament. Final numbers were expected later Tuesday, but the results of the world's biggest democratic elections appeared clear: Modi will keep his job, but with a smaller mandate than was widely expected or promised by his party.\n\nFor the first time ever, the giant of Indian politics for more than a decade will be forced to form a coalition government with smaller, albeit allied parties.\n\nThe final results were expected to maintain the balance revealed by preliminary ballot counting, which showed the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) winning around 295 of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.\n\nThat would put the NDA easily over the 272-seat threshold required to form a new government and almost certainly see Modi carry on as premier \u2014 but it's a much smaller share of the votes than the BJP had promised with its slogan of \"Abki Baar 400 paar,\" or \"will cross 400 this time.\"\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Amit Shah (R) shakes hands with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi (C) as India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh looks on during the celebrations after their victory in India's general election, in New Delhi, June 4, 2024. MONEY SHARMA/AFP/Getty\n\nThe BJP alone did not muster the votes to form a third single-party government under its leader.\n\nIt's also a much smaller majority than was predicted for the NDA by most exit polls, which had largely forecast a huge 350-seat win for the alliance.\n\nMore than 643 million people \u2014 among nearly a billion eligible voters \u2014 headed to the polls over the course of India's massive, seven-phase election. It was conducted over six seeks and was marked by a bitter campaign that played out along religious and sectarian lines. The voting was also held during a scorching heat wave that has been blamed for the deaths of about 80 people across the country, including at least 10 polling officials.\n\nOverall, the NDA alliance appears set to lose more than 60 seats in comparison to its performance in the last general elections five years ago, and the rival INDIA alliance (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance), led by the opposition Congress party, looks set to gain more than 100 new seats. That will give INDIA more than 230 seats in total \u2013 at a time when it had been all but written off by many political pundits and pollsters.\n\nStill, speaking Tuesday evening at BJP headquarters, Modi remained upbeat about what was, regardless of margins, a victory, calling the results a \"victory of the world's biggest democracy\" and \"a win for the 1.4 billion people of India.\"\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gestures at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) headquarters in New Delhi, India, June 4, 2024. Adnan Abidi/REUTERS\n\n\"Every Indian is proud of the country's election process and credibility,\" declared the incumbent.\n\nBut the mood on Tuesday at the Congress party headquarters in Delhi was also celebratory, despite them not winning the election, as leaders declared the performance a sign of the \"revitalization\" of a party that has ruled India for more than 50 of its 77 years as an independent nation.\n\n\"It was a fight to save the constitution,\" senior Congress figure Rahul Gandhi told reporters Tuesday. \"Congress and its alliance partners were not only fighting against the BJP, but also against the government institutions, intelligence agencies, half the judiciary which were captured by PM Modi.\"\n\n\"The people of India have saved the Constitution and democracy,\" he said in a tweet. \"The deprived and poor population of the country stood with India to protect their rights.\"\n\nThe BJP-led alliance suffered major losses in the bellwether states of Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 members to parliament, and Maharashtra, which has 48 seats, when compared to its performance in the last two general elections in 2019 and 2014, when they won record-breaking majorities.\n\nThe Congress-led alliance made major gains in both states, including in the Uttar Pradesh metropolis of Ayodhya, where Modi personally \u2014 and controversially \u2014 opened a vast new Hindu temple, the Ram Mandir, just months ahead of the election.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends the inauguration of the grand temple of the Hindu god Lord Ram in Ayodhya, India, Jan. 22, 2024. India's Press Information Bureau/Handout/REUTERS\n\n\"I think the BJP played the Ram Mandir card too early,\" Dr. Subir Sinha, Director of the South Asia Institute at the University of London, told CBS News, referring to the temple in Ayodhya. Construction of the massive temple, on the site of a razed mosque, has been central to the BJP's Hindu nationalist politics for a long time, in a country deeply divided along religious lines.\n\n\"The BJP had thought it was a vote-getting machine,\" said Sinha.\n\nThe BJP alliance's reduced parliamentary majority may mean that some of Modi's unspecified, \"big and tough decisions,\" which he'd vowed to make in the first 100 days of his third term, \"will have to be off the table,\" Sinha predicted.\n\n\"The BJP relied on Modi's popularity to push through a lot of local candidates who were not popular themselves,\" Dr. Irfan Nooruddin, professor of Indian politics at Georgetown University, told CBS News.\n\nHe said the BJP's shrunken majority would make it harder for Modi's government to push through some of its anticipated reform measures and force him to work more flexibly with a new coalition government, \"something that Prime Minister Modi was not used to.\"\n\nVote counting was expected to conclude Tuesday night and the swearing-in ceremony of the new government was expected on June 10.",

      "title": "India election results: Big wins, losses and surprises",
      "news": "As India\u2019s election results become clearer with hundreds of millions of votes counted and leads solidifying for most of the 543 parliamentary seats, the world\u2019s \u2013 and history\u2019s \u2013 largest democratic exercise appears to have thrown up some big surprises.\n\nAs counting progressed on Tuesday, the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi looked likely to fall short of the 272-seat mark that signifies a majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India\u2019s Parliament. With its allies, the BJP was still projected to win a majority. The opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Indian National Congress party, was projected to win more than 200 seats.\n\nThese numbers contrast sharply with 2019 results when the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 353 seats, 303 of which were bagged by the BJP alone.\n\nAt the heart of this shift was a series of political tremors that appear to have reshaped India\u2019s political landscape.\n\nAl Jazeera is tracking some of the biggest surprises and upsets as they unfold.\n\nUttar Pradesh: A tight Varanasi race and the rise of SP\n\nUttar Pradesh (UP), a state governed by the BJP since 2017, has a total of 80 parliamentary constituencies. Being India\u2019s most populous state with more than 240 million people, it holds the key to determining who governs in New Delhi. Moreover, both Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi are contesting elections from different constituencies in the state.\n\nIn 2019, the NDA won 64 seats, of which the BJP alone grabbed 62. The Congress won only one seat, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) won 10 and the Samajwadi Party (SP) won five.\n\nBut the 2024 outcome looks very different. As of 9pm (15:30 GMT), the SP was leading in 37 seats and the Congress in six \u2013 totalling 43 for the INDIA alliance.\n\nThe BJP, meanwhile, was leading in 33 seats with its allies ahead in three other seats. Most stunningly, the BJP was trailing in Faizabad constituency, which is home to the Ram temple in Ayodhya, which Modi consecrated in January. The temple \u2013 built on the ruins of the Babri Mosque, which was demolished by a Hindu mob in 1992 \u2013 was a centrepiece of the BJP\u2019s campaign.\n\nPolitical analyst and Hindi Professor Apoorvanand told Al Jazeera that the partnership between the SP and the Congress worked better this time than in the past, adding that the chemistry between SP leader Akhilesh Yadav and Gandhi was stronger \u201cand it perforated downwards\u201d.\n\nBesides securing its usual voter base, which consists of Muslims and the Yadav community, the SP expanded into other marginalised communities, Apoorvanand said. He added that growing discontent with the BJP among those below the age of 35 also contributed, making the party lose its influence in the northern state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to the youth of all parts of UP, and they are angry with the BJP,\u201d he added. He explained that this was due to the mismatch between the illusion of a utopia of a Hindu nation that the BJP tried to emphasise, even as the reality of rising unemployment hit voters.\n\n\u201cPeople wondered what is the point of a whole utopia of a Hindu nation if they cannot live in dignity,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Modi\u2019s constituency, Varanasi, Congress candidate Ajay Rai appears to have significantly eaten into the prime minister\u2019s 2019 victory margin. Modi won the seat by 500,000 votes five years ago. This time, his margin of victory was 152,000 votes.\n\nBy contrast, Gandhi won Rae Bareli, his constituency, by 390,000 votes.\n\nIn nearby Amethi, the BJP\u2019s Smriti Irani also lost to the Congress\u2019s Kishori Lal. In 2019, Irani had won the Gandhi family bastion, unseating Rahul Gandhi, who had held the seat since 2014, by 55,000 votes.\n\nWest Bengal: Trinamool holds its fort\n\nThe key eastern state is currently governed by the opposition All India Trinamool Congress party, commonly known as TMC, a reluctant member of the INDIA alliance.\n\nThe BJP made a significant improvement in the 2019 elections compared with 2014, bagging 19 of West Bengal\u2019s 42 parliamentary seats. The TMC won 22 while the Congress got two seats.\n\nIn advance of counting, exit polls had predicted the BJP could win a vast majority of the state\u2019s seats, reducing the TMC\u2019s numbers.\n\nBut on Tuesday, those predictions turned out to be inaccurate. The TMC was on course to win 29 seats with the BJP expected to win only 12. The Congress leads in the remaining seat.\n\nKerala: How the BJP breached its final frontier\n\nThe southern state has long been a bastion of the left where the BJP, with its Hindu majoritarian politics, has struggled to win.\n\nThat changed this year when the party\u2019s Suresh Gopi won by a margin of 74,686 votes in the Thrissur constituency and became the BJP\u2019s first Lok Sabha parliamentarian from Kerala.\n\nSo how did the BJP do this? In part, political analyst Apoorvanand said, by \u201caligning and trying to collaborate with the Islamophobic elements within the Christian communities in Kerala\u201d.\n\nHindus make up 55 percent of the state\u2019s population, followed by Muslims at 27 percent and Christians at 18 percent. Together, the two minority groups make up nearly half of the population, making them formidable forces in elections.\n\nBut in recent years, the BJP, in addition to wooing the Hindu vote, has tried to win over sections of the Christian vote by presenting the state\u2019s Muslims as a threat, its critics said.\n\nApoorvanand pointed to the conspiracy theory of \u201clove jihad\u201d, which suggests that Muslim men are deliberately marrying women from Hindu and Christian communities to convert them to Islam. The conspiracy theory has been widely debunked. But as Apoorvanand pointed out, it \u201coriginated from Kerala\u201d and some members of the Christian clergy have amplified it.\n\n\u2018Politics of humiliation\u2019: How the BJP lost Maharashtra plot\n\nThe BJP and its allies appeared on the cusp of big losses in the western state of Maharashtra as the Congress and its partners made key gains.\n\nAccording to the latest vote count, the opposition INDIA alliance \u2013 which includes the Congress, Shiv Sena and the SP \u2013 was ahead in 29 of the state\u2019s 48 seats. The Congress alone was leading in 13 seats while the BJP was ahead in 10.\n\nThese results are not surprising, according to Apoorvanand, even though exit polls had predicted a big win for the BJP and its allies in the state.\n\nApoorvanand attributed the outcome to \u201cthe way BJP performed in the past five years, humiliating parties and state leaders\u201d. He said the BJP\u2019s \u201cpolitics of humiliation\u201d bred discontent for the party among voters.\n\nTraditionally, the BJP has partnered with the regional Shiv Sena party. But over the past five years, that alliance broke down, and critics accused the BJP of orchestrating a fracture within the Shiv Sena.\n\n\u201cThat was the last thing the people of Maharashtra could bear,\u201d Apoorvanand said. \u201cWhat we are expecting in Maharashtra applies to the rest of India, which is some kind of normalcy in politics.\u201d\n\nKarnataka: BJP bent, not broken\n\nIn 2019, the BJP won 25 of Karnataka\u2019s 28 parliamentary constituencies while two other NDA-affiliated candidates also won. The Congress won just one seat.\n\nAlthough the Congress won elections for the state legislature last year, exit polls had predicted a repeat of the 2019 results, especially with the BJP also tying up with the regional Janata Dal (Secular) party.\n\nHowever, this year, while the BJP emerged as the biggest winner, it won only 17 seats. The JD(S) won in two constituencies and the Congress won 10 seats.\n\n\u201cThe stronghold of the BJP still remains in coastal states such as Mangalore [Mangaluru], where they have not lost ground,\u201d Apoorvanand said. The key takeaway? \u201cThe BJP base is eroded but has not completely lost influence,\u201d he said.\n\nKarnataka is crucial for the BJP. It is the only southern state that Modi\u2019s party has ever won.",

      "title": "India election 2024: Why Modi failed to win outright majority",
      "news": "Why India's Modi failed to win outright majority\n\n2 hours ago Soutik Biswas , India correspondent , @soutikBBC Share\n\nAFP The results are a personal blow to Mr Modi, who has never fallen short of a majority\n\nIndian PM Narendra Modi is on course for a third consecutive term in a much tighter general election than anticipated. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looks set to fall short of a majority and is leading narrowly in the 543-seat parliament, below the required 272 seats. However, its coalition partners have gained additional seats. The results are a personal blow to Mr Modi, who has always secured majorities in elections as both chief minister of Gujarat state and India\u2019s prime minister, and dominated the country's politics for a decade. The verdict marks a surprising revival for the Congress Party-led INDIA opposition alliance, defying earlier predictions of its decline, and sharply diverging from both exit polls and pre-election surveys. More than 640 million people voted in a marathon seven-week election, hailed as a \"world record\" by election authorities. Nearly half of the voters were women.\n\nGetty Images The opposition has staged a remarkable comeback under Rahul Gandhi\n\nMany world leaders have crawled across the finishing line in their third term elections and Mr Modi is no exception. The BJP remains India\u2019s single largest party by seats, and if Mr Modi secures a third term with his allies, the prime minister matches the record of Jawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s first premier. But the significant loss of seats for his party - more than 50 - dims the allure of a third term, especially given Mr Modi's campaign targeting 400 coalition seats, making anything less seem like an under-achievement. This has led to jubilation in the Congress camp and some despair in BJP quarters. Despite the BJP emerging as the single largest party, the burden of hype and expectations has left many of their supporters disheartened. Mr Modi's supporters believe securing a third term can be attributed to several factors: a record of stable governance, the appeal of continuity, efficient welfare programmes, and the perception that he has enhanced India's global image. To his Hindu nationalist base, Mr Modi delivered on key manifesto promises: revoking the autonomy of Indian-administered Kashmir, building the Ram temple in Ayodhya and implementing a controversial citizenship law. Many BJP-ruled states have implemented laws tightening regulations on interfaith marriages.\n\nAFP Mr Modi appealed to his Hindu nationalist base by building the Ram temple in Ayodhya\n\nThe BJP's significant drop in seats may be linked to joblessness, rising prices, growing inequality and a controversial army recruitment reform, among other things. Mr Modi's harsh and divisive campaign, particularly targeting Muslims, could also have alienated voters in some regions. His ambitious slogan \"Ab ki baar, 400 paar,\" aiming for more than 400 seats for his NDA alliance, may have backfired, with such a massive majority raising fears of constitutional changes among the poor. Mr Modi\u2019s party faced its largest setback in Uttar Pradesh (UP), a state larger than the United Kingdom and three times as populous. With 80 parliamentary seats, UP holds significant sway in national politics - many consider it the gateway to Delhi. Both Mr Modi and Rahul Gandhi hold seats there.\n\nAFP The election results show that Brand Modi has lost some of its shine\n\nSo what are the main takeaways of this election? A dent of Brand Modi Mr Modi\u2019s popularity has been also attributed to his mastery of branding, transforming routine events into spectacles and astute messaging. A weak opposition and a largely friendly media also helped him build his brand. The election results show that Brand Modi has lost some of its shine, indicating that even Mr Modi is susceptible to anti-incumbency. In other words, he is not as invincible as many of his supporters believed. This offers renewed hope to the opposition. A return to coalition politics India has a history of chaotic coalition governments, although some in the early 1990s and 2000s played a significant role in implementing economic reforms. If the BJP forms the government, it will be dependent on allies and will need to adopt a more consultative and deliberative approach. This dependency makes it vulnerable to collapse if allies feel neglected. The party, once perceived as all-powerful, is now reliant on allies, unlike in 2014 and 2019.\n\nAFP Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi have forged a successful coalition in Uttar Pradesh\n\nA jolt to the dominant BJP Mr Modi's uninterrupted decade-long reign at the top has underscored India's embrace of what some political scientists term the one-party dominant system. This has five key traits: a charismatic leader, unrivaled control over resources and communication, unmatched organisational machinery, and an opposition in disarray. Shrinking freedoms also characterise a one-party dominant system. Mr Modi\u2019s BJP is not the first party to dominate Indian politics. For many years after Independence the Congress ruled without a break. Tuesday\u2019s result has restored India to what many consider \"normal politics\", with a range of parties sharing and competing for power.\n\nGetty Images N Chandrababu Naidu's regional TDP is an ally of Mr Modi\n\nA resurgent opposition The results will energise the much-criticised Congress-led opposition. In February, the diverse coalition known as INDIA, short for Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, faced turmoil when one of its key leaders, Nitish Kumar, exited - only to later rejoin the BJP. But led by Rahul Gandhi, the opposition ran a spirited campaign and narrowed the gap, in the face of a partisan media and despite fewer resources. There is more hope for them ahead. The BJP holds about a third of India\u2019s 4,000- plus state assembly seats and has lost to regional parties before. Over the next 14 months, five states are set for elections - all could be keenly contested. With contests in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, and Haryana this year, the BJP could face substantial competition. Delhi's upcoming election may pose challenges, while Bihar in October presents a regional hurdle.\n\nGetty Images Mr Modi has his task cut out in a potential third term",

      "title": "India elections: Modi declares victory but party faces shock losses in parliament and will need coalition",
      "news": "New Delhi CNN \u2014\n\nIndia\u2019s transformative yet divisive Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared victory in national elections on Tuesday evening but his goal of winning an unassailable majority lies in tatters with early results showing voters delivered a shock result that reduces the extent of his party\u2019s grip on power.\n\n\u201cToday is a glorious day\u2026 National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the third time, we are grateful to the people,\u201d Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi, referring to the initials of his political alliance. \u201cThis is a victory for the world\u2019s largest democracy.\u201d\n\nPreliminary figures from the election commission indicate Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party falling short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on longstanding coalition partners to form a government.\n\nModi is still set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies \u2013 a third consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India.\n\nBut the results are nonetheless something of a personal blow to Modi, who had triumphantly vowed to win a 400-seat supermajority in this year\u2019s election \u2013 and romped to victory the last two contests with a simple majority for the BJP, turning his Hindu nationalist right-wing party into an electoral juggernaut.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gestures as he arrives at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) headquarters in New Delhi, India, on June 4. Adnan Abidi/Reuters\n\nSupporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) celebrate as they learn early election results on June 04, 2024 in Bengaluru, India. Abhishek Chinnappa/Getty Images\n\nIndia\u2019s opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi\u2019s divisive style.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the leader of India\u2019s National Congress, said early election results showed that the \u201ccountry has unanimously and clearly\u201d stated that it does not want Modi and his party to run the country.\n\n\u201cWe do not appreciate the way they have run this country for the last 10 years so that is a huge message for Mr. Narendra Modi,\u201d he said outside his party\u2019s headquarters in New Delhi.\n\nCongress led an alliance of opposition parties that tried to topple Modi. While they look set to have failed in that task, they have dented his previous aura of electoral invincibility.\n\nPreliminary results also suggest they have chipped away at BJP seats, including in some of the ruling party\u2019s traditional strongholds. Congress alone are currently set to double the number of seats they won in 2019, even taking key seats in traditional BJP strongholds.\n\nThe election commission preliminary figures currently have the BJP\u2019s alliance winning around 300 seats compared to 230 for the opposition alliances.\n\nElection authorities are still counting votes and final results are expected in the coming hours.\n\nMeanwhile Indian stocks plunged Tuesday as Modi\u2019s dream of a landslide victory slipped away, raising doubts about his ability to push through more aggressive economic reforms.\n\n\u2018Sent by god\u2019\n\nTo his millions of supporters in the Hindu majority nation, 73-year-old Modi is an icon whose policies have transformed ordinary people\u2019s lives and helped realize the nascent promise of social mobility in a country once left impoverished by colonialism now embracing the 21st century with economic growth and confidence.\n\nWhen he ran for office in 2014, he said he was a \u201cservant\u201d to India\u2019s 1.4 billion citizens. Five years later, he positioned himself as the nation\u2019s \u201cchowkidar\u201d or \u201cwatchman,\u201d promising to guard them from all possible threats. This year, he claimed to have been sent by god, chosen by the divine to \u201crepresent all the people of India.\u201d\n\nBut to many religious minorities in the diverse democracy, that final statement is both loaded and fearsome.\n\nReligious persecution and Islamophobia have increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party\u2019s Hindu-nationalist dreams.\n\nThey say the prime minister is dragging India away from the constitutionally secular roots and transforming India into a majoritarian Hindu state, an evolution with potentially profound implications in a giant nation with a troubled history of explosive inter-communal violence.\n\nGiven India\u2019s strategic position in Asia and its booming economy, Modi\u2019s victory will reverberate far beyond its borders, capturing the attention of the United States, China and Russia in particular.\n\nWashington has long seen New Delhi as a regional crucial bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. But at the same time India remains close to Moscow and has thirstily snapped up cheap Russian oil despite the invasion of Ukraine and western-led sanctions.\n\nModi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047, the centenary of independence from colonial British rule. He inherited a rising economy and India\u2019s growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce.\n\nBut that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with youth unemployment spiraling and much of the country\u2019s growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\nFrom April 19 to June 1, more than 640 million people cast their vote at polling stations across the country, from the high peaks of the Himalayas to the remote jungles of the west. And though turnout slightly dipped from the record levels of 2019, that a democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity.\n\n\u201cNo one can do for us what our Prime Minister Modi can,\u201d said BJP worker Rajgopal Kashyap, from the party\u2019s headquarters in New Delhi. \u201cHe has come to us as an instrument of God. He will take our country forward and is the only one who can run the country.\u201d\n\nNo modern Indian politician has been able to establish the cult-like following that Modi has.\n\nAt his rallies, tens of thousands gather in religious devotion to glimpse a man they say they hope never loses his grip on power. His face is plastered on buses and billboards across the country, and his voice enters the homes of millions every month via his flagship radio program and increasingly pliant media landscape.\n\n\u201cLook at the way he has projected his personality,\u201d his unofficial biographer Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay told CNN. \u201cVery finely manicured, (someone) who exudes power. He is a very performative political leader. He is no less than a rock star on the stage.\u201d\n\nSupporters say he is the best person to cement the country\u2019s rank as a major global player.\n\n\u201cFor us middle-class people, (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) is the only one who has done anything, who has shined India\u2019s name abroad,\u201d said Surjeet Singh, a driver in New Delhi.\n\nPolitical scientist Christophe Jaffrelot says such sentiment \u201ccan be seen across the board.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a feeling that Modi makes Indians \u201cproud again,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a sense in India of vulnerability, lack of self-esteem. So, to be recognized as a great power despite everything is attributed to him.\u201d\n\n\u2018We won\u2019t be safe\u2019\n\nModi projects himself as an outsider from humble origins. The son of a tea seller from a small town in Gujarat state, his story, his colleagues say, resonates with millions. \u201cHe comes from a poor background and that helps him understands the people of India,\u201d Varanasi BJP president Dileep Patel previously told CNN.\n\nOver the last decade his administration has upgraded the country\u2019s aging transport network, building highways to connect small villages with major cities. He has overseen the development of new power plants and maritime projects and, according to recent remarks from Modi himself, subsidized the construction of some 40 million concrete homes for improvised families.\n\nHis decade in power has not been without controversy.\n\nModi faced widespread criticism early in his tenure when he banned India\u2019s 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes, deeming them \u201cworthless pieces of paper,\u201d sparking panic in the cash heavy economy.\n\nIn 2019, he faced the wrath of angry farmers when they took to the streets to demand guaranteed prices for their crops in the biggest protests the country has ever seen. Two years later, critics blamed him for mismanaging the country\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to more than half a million deaths, according to official figures.\n\nAnd for some observers, a troubling, divisive pattern has also emerged through the years.\n\nAnother five years of Modi, said Congress supporter Sunita Gautam, will be \u201chorrible plight for women\u201d and minorities.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be safe. It\u2019s horrible for Muslims. It\u2019s horrible for Dalits. Who is it good for?\u201d she asked. \u201cModi promised employment for youth but look at the number of people unemployed.\u201d\n\nThis breaking news story has been updated.",

      "title": "Modi\u2019s BJP to lose majority in India election shock, needs allies for gov\u2019t",
      "news": "New Delhi, India \u2014 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is on course to lose its national majority after suffering major losses in key states, marking a dramatic shift in a political landscape it has dominated for the past decade.\n\nThe BJP is on track to comfortably emerge as the country\u2019s single-largest party in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India\u2019s parliament. But as election officials declared leads and results from India\u2019s six-week-long election on Tuesday, it became apparent that the BJP would struggle to repeat its performances from 2014 and 2019.\n\nUnlike both those elections, when the BJP won clear majorities on its own in a house of 543 seats, its leads and wins were hovering around 240 constituencies through much of the day. The halfway mark is 272 seats.\n\nBy contrast, the opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party, was projected to win more than 200 seats, suggesting a far closer contest than exit polls had predicted. Released on June 1 after the final phase of India\u2019s election cycle, the exit polls had suggested that the BJP would outdo its 2019 tally of 303 seats.\n\nModi and his party are still likely to be able to form India\u2019s next government \u2014 but will be dependent on a clutch of allies whose support they will need to cross the 272-seat mark. The BJP with its allies \u2014 their coalition is known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) \u2014 was projected to win around 290 seats in the late afternoon on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIndia will likely have an NDA government, where the BJP does not have a majority on their own, and coalition politics will come into real play,\u201d said Sandeep Shastri, the national coordinator of the Lokniti Network, a research programme at the New Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS).\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Modi claimed, in his first comments after the results were declared, victory for his NDA coalition. \u201cWe will form the next government,\u201d he said, speaking to thousands of supporters gathered at the BJP\u2019s party headquarters in New Delhi.\n\nPeople have placed their faith in NDA, for a third consecutive time! This is a historical feat in India\u2019s history. I bow to the Janata Janardan for this affection and assure them that we will continue the good work done in the last decade to keep fulfilling the aspirations of\u2026 \u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 4, 2024\n\nYet analysts said that the electoral verdict raised questions about the BJP\u2019s strategy. As India\u2019s long-drawn-out election campaign played out, Modi, India\u2019s charismatic and polarising prime minister, had increasingly turned to fearmongering over an alleged plot by the opposition to hand over the nation\u2019s resources to Muslims, at the cost of its majority Hindus. Meanwhile, the opposition had tried to corner Modi on his government\u2019s economic track record: While the country is the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy, voters told pollsters ahead of the election that high inflation and unemployment were key concerns for them.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cAbki baar, 400 paar (This time, more than 400)\u201d, set a target of 400 seats for its alliance, and 370 seats for the BJP itself.\n\nThat pitch carried a \u201ctone of overconfidence\u201d, said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a Modi biographer, at a time when many in the Indian public were dealing with the lived realities of soaring prices, joblessness and income inequality so wide that it is now worse than during British colonial rule. The result was the \u201csleepwalking of the BJP into a disaster\u201d, said Asim Ali, a political analyst and columnist.\n\n\u201cToday, Modi has lost his face. He is not that \u2018undefeated person\u2019 and his invincible aura is not there anymore,\u201d said Ali.\n\nForming the next government\n\nIn some ways, the election verdict carries echoes of 2004, when another incumbent BJP government under then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was widely expected to win a landslide mandate by exit polls.\n\nInstead, the Congress marginally edged the BJP in wins, and formed the government with its allies.\n\nBut 2024 is not 2004. Despite the setbacks, the BJP is still by far the largest party in parliament, and in position to form the next government along with its NDA allies. Congress, the largest opposition party, is projected to win around 100 seats, less than half of the tally the BJP is expected to end up with when all votes are counted.\n\nStill, two regional parties will now hold the key to the office of the prime minister of India: Janata Dal-United, led by Nitish Kumar in the state of Bihar; and the Telugu Desam Party, led by Chandrababu Naidu in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The TDP is leading in 16 seats and the JD(U) in 12. Both the parties have also previously been in alliance with the Congress party.\n\nWhile the BJP has made noticeable inroads in southern India \u2014 especially Kerala, where it won its first-ever Lok Sabha seat \u2014 its overall numbers were hit by major losses in the central Hindi-speaking states, which it had swept in the last election.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s biggest state and a key determinant of who rules nationally, the Hindu-nationalist party lost in the Faizabad parliamentary district, home to the controversial Ram Temple, built upon the ruins of the 16th-century Babri Masjid. Modi had consecrated the temple in January.\n\nThe consecration of the Ram Temple, overseen by Modi, was at the forefront of the BJP\u2019s campaign to mobilise the Hindu voters. The party also lost the key seat of Amethi, where federal minister Smriti Irani is staring at defeat. Irani had pulled off a spectacular win over Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Gandhi family, by 55,000 votes in 2019. This year, Gandhi contested from neighbouring Rae Bareli constituency and won the seat by a margin more than twice the size by which Modi won his seat, Varanasi, also in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe BJP also suffered losses in Maharashtra, India\u2019s second-most politically critical state. At 9pm India time (15:30 GMT), with most votes counted, the INDIA alliance was ahead in 29 of the state\u2019s 48 seats. Only Uttar Pradesh has more seats \u2014 80. In 2019, the BJP alone had won 23 seats in Maharashtra, with its allies winning another 18.\n\nAlong with Maharashtra, three other states that have been epicentres of India\u2019s agrarian crisis, with major farm protests, also saw losses for the BJP compared to 2019: Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab. The BJP rules the states of Haryana and Rajasthan.\n\nCongress celebrations\n\nAs soon as the initial trends trickled in Tuesday morning, Congress supporters thronged the party headquarters in New Delhi. Supporters were seen sporting white T-shirts with photos of Rahul Gandhi on the back, as they waved the party flags, their eyes glued to giant screens broadcasting results live.\n\n\u201cNow, at least Indian people will have a voice to raise against the cruel BJP, who ruled us for the last 10 years. More seats mean we have a good say and a strong opposition,\u201d said Suresh Verma, a Congress supporter.\n\nThat changed composition of India\u2019s next parliament might also affect how laws are passed. Critics have accused the BJP government of ramming laws through parliament without discussions and debate.\n\nThat won\u2019t be easy anymore, said Shastri. \u201cIt is going to be a much tougher ride in the parliament, very clearly, for the BJP,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond parliament, analysts said a weakened mandate could impact the functioning of India\u2019s other democratic institutions, which critics have accused the BJP of appropriating for partisan politics.\n\n\u201cUnder brute majority, institutions have collapsed in India under the BJP. The power system was very centralised at the top, and India needs these kinds of coalition-based governments for its democracy to survive,\u201d Ali said.\n\nWhat next for the BJP?\n\nOnce the immediate dust settles over these results, the BJP will introspect and the dominant duo of Modi and Amit Shah, India\u2019s home minister who is widely seen as the prime minister\u2019s deputy, will face tougher questions. \u201cThere will be questions on imagining Modi as a leader of the alliance, where he would have to listen to non-BJP leaders much more,\u201d said Shastri of the CSDS.\n\nAli, the political analyst, also noted that \u201cthe BJP failed to read the ground\u201d, and a set of yes men around Modi potentially blindsided his party. \u201cIt is like the king was only told the tales that he wanted to hear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for the BJP that there is a feedback mechanism and decentralisation of the power.\u201d\n\nOver the past decade under a majority BJP government under Modi, India has slid on several democratic indices amid accusations of a crackdown on dissent, political opposition, and media. Modi did not address any press conferences in the last decade as a prime minister.\n\nWith coalition partners to keep a check on the BJP, there \u201cwill be breathing space for the Indian civil society and the government\u2019s critics\u201d, said Mukhopadhyay, the biographer.\n\nTo many Indian Muslims, the outcome also means relief.\n\nWatching the results from his shanty in northeastern New Delhi, Akbar Khan, a 33-year-old waste picker, said he was delighted. While all of Delhi\u2019s seats are currently being led by the BJP in trends, Khan said that \u201cthe people came out on streets and have fought this election against the [incumbent] government\u201d.\n\nKhan, who also works with waste picker communities in states like Bihar and Jharkhand, said, \u201cThe economically backward castes and classes are hugely upset with Modi, and his divisive politics have not borne any fruits in their kitchen.\u201d\n\nAs a Muslim, Khan said, he was upset by Modi\u2019s Islamophobic remarks during the re-election campaign, where he equated the community with \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and described them as people \u201cwho have more children\u201d.\n\n\u201cIndians needed to vote against this hate from Modi and the BJP,\u201d he said.",

      "title": "Modi May Fall Short of Landslide India Election Win: Results",
      "news": "Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is leading in the 2024 Indian election as the results trickle in on Tuesday, but early trends suggest the Prime Minister\u2019s government may not win the two-thirds supermajority predicted by exit polls.\n\nEarly results show that the BJP and its National Democratic Alliance, which also includes other parties on the right, is ahead so far, winning 295 seats in India\u2019s 543-seat Lok Sabha, or the lower house of parliament. Any party or alliance that wins more than 272 seats can form a majority government in India.\n\nIn contrast, the opposition INDIA alliance\u2014which is made up of more than 20 opposition parties including the Indian National Congress\u2014has so far won 230 seats, performing better than expected in this election. That result would mean Modi\u2019s BJP has not won the 400-seat supermajority it sought this election cycle.\n\nWhatever the final count, the 73-year-old Modi, a charismatic yet polarizing leader, is on track to win enough seats for a rare third consecutive five-year term as Prime Minister. Only one other Indian Prime Minister, Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru, has served three consecutive terms.\n\nThe vote, which began on April 19 and concluded on June 1, was carried out in seven phases over six weeks and saw over 1 billion Indians heading to the polls\u2014making it the largest democratic election in the world.\n\nRead More: Why India\u2019s Next Election Will Last 44 Days\n\nThe BJP\u2019s projected outright majority means that it will likely be able to continue its Hindu-nationalist agenda and pursue a slate of economic reforms.\n\nBut a smaller-than-expected majority means that Modi may face a more powerful opposition than at any point over the past decade, making implementation more difficult unless the BJP works with smaller alliances and negotiates with opposition leaders.\n\nThis is a developing story.

      "title": "Indian Stocks Lose $386 Billion as Polls Tighter Than Forecast",
      "news": "(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s stocks market plummeted, erasing $386 billion in market value, as tallies signaled that Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling party was struggling to win a majority of seats in national elections, a stunning result after exit polls showed he was on pace for a landslide victory.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe NSE Nifty 50 Index tumbled 5.9% in Mumbai, its worst day in more than four years, as counts showed Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies in the National Democratic Alliance were leading in more than 290 seats, slightly more than 272 needed for a majority in parliament and well short of the roughly 350 they won in 2019. The rupee fell the most in a year and the 10-year yield rose.\n\nA narrower-than-expected victory for Modi\u2019s alliance will raise questions about the new government\u2019s ability to push through politically difficult reforms in land and labor laws \u2014 seen as crucial by some investors to sustain India\u2019s economic growth, already the world\u2019s fastest. Before voting kicked off on April 19, Modi had boldly predicted that his alliance would win a whopping 400 seats.\n\n\u201cAs BJP does not have a simple majority, the bargaining power shifts materially within the alliance,\u201d Sunil Tirumalai, strategist at UBS Group AG, wrote in a note. \u201cMost scenarios from here could be taken negatively by the market compared to expectations last week.\u201d\n\nMore than 20 opposition parties, spearheaded by Rahul Gandhi, formed a united front called the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance in a bid to defeat Modi. A mixture of regional and caste-based groups, the alliance focused on appealing to voters who felt left out of India\u2019s growth story, which has been marked by growing inequality, pervasive joblessness, rising living costs and growing demand for welfare support. It was on course to win more than 180 seats.\n\nBusinesses linked to the government\u2019s development goals tumbled, with Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd. taking a nosedive. The yield on the 10-year bond rose eight basis points to 7.03%, the biggest jump since October.\n\nThe Nifty tumbled as much as 8.5% at one point, coming close to hitting its first circuit limit since Covid-era crash in March 2020. The selloff had echoes from the 2004 elections when the BJP\u2019s unexpected defeat triggered a market crash. Trading was suspended twice when the S&P BSE Sensex fell more than the 10% limit, the first time in the exchange\u2019s history.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rout eroded the combined market value of BSE-listed companies by $386 billion to $4.73 trillion, according to data available on the exchange\u2019s website.\n\nVolatility spiked with a gauge of 30-day ahead implied swings on the NSE rising the most in two years. An index of so-called Modi stocks, as termed by CLSA, slumped, with Adani Group\u2019s flagship unit Adani Enterprises Ltd. among the biggest decliners.\n\nAhead of the exit polls, which had predicted the BJP-led alliance would win over 350 of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament, a Bloomberg survey had shown that stocks may tumble by as much as 10% if the BJP fails to cross the halfway mark of 272 seats. Opposition leaders had dismissed the exit polls when they were released over the weekend, and a senior Congress party leader described the early results on Tuesday as a \u201cpleasant surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were against a lot of cynicism,\u201d said Salman Khurshid, speaking to deKoder, an online news channel. \u201cOur own reading on the ground was that something like this will happen or something better than this will happen.\u201d\n\nWhile the BJP-led alliance is still set to win a third term, Modi will now be more beholden on coalition partners for support \u2014 including two regional party leaders who have frequently switched allegiances in the past. One of them \u2014 Nitish Kumar, chief minister of northern Bihar state and leader of the Janata Dal (United) \u2014 had been a member of the opposition alliance when it first formed last year before defecting. The other is N Chandrababu Naidu from southern Andhra Pradesh state, who has also worked with various coalitions.\n\nNonetheless, investors are banking on continuity in the government\u2019s infrastructure and manufacture-led drive to boost growth.\n\n\u201cI still think the policy direction of Modi will likely stay, which should support India\u2019s economy in the longer term,\u201d said Dong Chen, chief Asia strategist at Banque Pictet. \u201cThe valuations are expensive but we will be watching for any correction closely as it may create some entry opportunities.\u201d\n\nModi had touted his administration\u2019s efforts on boosting capital formation, which has partly helped India\u2019s economy stay among the fastest growing in the world.\n\n\u201cIndian markets were trading at 140% market cap-to-GDP,\u201d said Sameer Kalra, founder of Target Investing Pvt., referring to the expensive equity valuations. \u201cIf there is some uncertainty in future policy moves there can be a major correction.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi, Khushi Malhotra, Malavika Kaur Makol and Kartik Goyal.\n\n(Updates bond yields in sixth paragraph.

      "news": "New Delhi CNN \u2014\n\nIndian stocks plunged Tuesday as vote counting in the country\u2019s election suggested Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s dream of a landslide victory is at risk, raising doubts about his ability to push through more aggressive economic reforms.\n\nIndia\u2019s benchmark Sensex index, which tracks 30 large companies, and the broader Nifty 50 index each closed down by nearly 6%.\n\nThe worst daily drop for Indian stocks since 2020 came just 24 hours after both indexes hit record highs as weekend exit polls prompted experts to predict a resounding victory for Modi. The world\u2019s biggest election concluded on Saturday.\n\nThe 73-year-old ran on his economic record over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was aiming to win a 400-seat supermajority in the 543-seat lower house of parliament, but preliminary results show the opposition Congress party is performing better than some analysts expected.\n\nA party or a coalition needs 272 seats to form a government. In India\u2019s last election in 2019, the BJP won 303 seats.\n\nIf the final results confirm that Modi has underperformed in the polls, key economic reforms may be put on the back burner.\n\n\u201cThe (early) election results are showing a less than halfway mark (272 seats) for the current BJP government, pointing towards a coalition government,\u201d said Yashovardhan Khemka, Senior Manager, Research & Analytics at Mumbai-based asset management firm Abans Holdings.\n\n\u201cThis will lead to dependence on allies in making key policy decision\u2026 which will lead to policy paralysis and uncertainty in the government\u2019s functioning,\u201d he added.\n\nIndia is the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy and is comfortably placed to expand at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, but analysts say it needs to achieve growth of 8% or more if it wants to become an economic superpower.\n\nSustained expansion would push India higher up the ranks of the world\u2019s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the United States and China by 2027.\n\nThe country\u2019s stock markets have performed well during Modi\u2019s tenure. Earlier this year, the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) overtook both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Exchange to become the world\u2019s sixth largest bourse, data from the World Federation of Exchanges showed.\n\nBut investors have complained about the high price of Indian stocks and some analysts believe a correction could be healthy for markets.\n\nAccording to Manish Jain, head of institutional business at Mirae Asset Capital Markets, if \u201cvaluations get more reasonable from here on,\u201d it would attract more investments to the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy, as \u201cIndia is a long term structural growth story.\u201d",

      "news": "At day\u2019s low, indexes saw biggest intraday fall since March 2020, when stocks were battered by first COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nIndian stocks have suffered their worst intraday fall since March 2020 and foreign investors sold the most on record, as vote-counting trends in the general election suggested Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s alliance was unlikely to win the overwhelming majority predicted by exit polls.\n\nWith over half the votes counted on Tuesday, Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looked unlikely to secure a majority on its own in the 543-member lower house of parliament and likely to need allies in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to form the government.\n\nThat could lead to some uncertainty over economic policies, such as the push for investment-led growth, which has been the cornerstone of the Modi government\u2019s rule. The Indian economy grew 8.2 percent in the financial year ended March 2024.\n\n\u201cThe key question is whether BJP can retain a single-party majority,\u201d said Ken Peng, head of investment strategy for Asia at Citi Global Wealth. \u201cIf not, then would its coalition be able to deliver economic development, particularly infrastructure?\u201d\n\nThe NSE Nifty 50 index closed down 5.93 percent at 21,884.5 points, and the S&P BSE Sensex fell 5.74 percent to 72,079.05. The indexes fell as much as 8.5 percent earlier in the day, after hitting record highs on Monday.\n\nAt the day\u2019s low, the indexes saw their biggest intraday fall since March 2020, when stocks were battered by the first lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cDue to the dependency on coalition partners, the upcoming NDA government may shift its focus towards a welfare-oriented approach rather than concentrating on reforms during the July budget,\u201d said Puneet Sharma, CEO and fund manager at Whitespace Alpha.\n\nIndian markets are likely to now derate due to higher risk perception, said analysts at brokerage Emkay Global, which believes that difficult reforms like changes to land and labour policies, along with privatisation of state-run enterprises, were \u201coff the table\u201d.\n\nExit polls over the weekend had projected a big win for Modi\u2019s NDA, catapulting markets to all-time highs on Monday as investors were buoyed by expectations of sustained economic growth.\n\n\u2018Policy continuity\u2019\n\nBenchmark indexes had more than tripled in value since Modi became prime minister in May 2014, as of Monday\u2019s close.\n\nForeign investors, who poured a net $20.7bn into Indian equities last year but pulled back ahead of the election, had been widely expected to turn buyers if the Modi alliance secured a decisive mandate.\n\nOn Tuesday, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold a record 124.36 billion rupees (about $1.5bn) worth of Indian shares, according to provisional data released Tuesday evening.\n\nThey had bought shares worth a net 68.51 billion rupees ($824.4m) on Monday.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the important thing is that the NDA returns to form the next government, which represents policy continuity,\u201d said Mike Sell, head of global emerging market equities at Alquity in London.\n\n\u201cWhether they win by 20 or 120 impacts the amount of structural reform that can take place, but ultimately a win is a win and the increasing positivity around the Indian structural growth story will be undiminished.\u201d\n\nThe lack of clarity on the margin of victory for the NDA saw intraday volatility on the share index rise to its highest level in 26 months.\n\nTraders said that selling by high-frequency traders accelerated the drop and the sharp fall triggered margin calls.\n\nThe market is witnessing a significant correction due to margin calls as retail investors were carrying heavily leveraged positions, said Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities.\n\nSome investors saw the decline as a buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the final election count, the India economy will continue to benefit from longer-term tailwinds of favourable population demographics and the ongoing geopolitical tensions between China and the US,\u201d said Gary Tan, portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments.\n\nInvestors expect the Modi government to continue focusing on turning the country into a manufacturing hub \u2013 a project that has courted foreign companies including Apple and Tesla to set up production as they diversify beyond China.\n\nThe rupee ended at 83.53 against the United States dollar, down 0.5 percent on the day, marking its worst single-day fall in 16 months. The benchmark 10-year bond yield rose 10 basis points on the day, its biggest on-day rise in eight months, ending at 7.03 percent.",

      "news": "BBC India reporters on why some voters said no to Modi\n\n4 hours ago Share\n\nWhat worked for India's Modi and what didn\u2019t?\n\nWhen Narendra Modi set his sights on a barnstorming victory - 400 out of 543 seats for his alliance - few scoffed at the ambition. After all, the Indian prime minister and his BJP have been a largely unstoppable force since coming to power a decade ago. But while Mr Modi and his alliance are on course to win a majority, it is not quite the untouchable win he and his allies envisioned when counting began this morning. Below, BBC correspondents in India give their thoughts on why we arrived at results few expected - and what it could mean for the world's largest democracy going forward.\n\nQuestions over use of 'Hindu card' as a campaign tool\n\nReligion is a factor in every Indian election, and this one was no different. Mr Modi inaugurated a Hindu temple at a controversial site that had been disputed between Hindus and Muslims in January and this was expected to give his party a big boost during the election. But no one quite expected the BJP\u2019s campaign to be as polarising as it was - or for some of the most aggressive comments to come from the very top. At a campaign rally in April, Mr Modi said: \u201cWhen their (the opposition Congress) government was in power they had said Muslims have the first right on the nation\u2019s wealth. This means they\u2019ll collect the wealth and give it to whom? To those who have many children. To infiltrators.\u201d Some analysts interpreted the remark as an attempt by Mr Modi to galvanise his conservative Hindu support base. But looking at the results from some key constituencies \u2013 the BJP candidate has lost in the temple city of Ayodhya - it doesn\u2019t appear to have had the desired effect. Questions are now being raised about using the Hindu card as a campaign tool, especially since what it seems to have achieved is the opposite - uniting Muslim minorities against the BJP. Yogita Limaye, BBC News in Dehli\n\n'Brand Modi is beginning to fray'\n\nReuters\n\nMarketing consultants have attributed Narendra Modi\u2019s enduring popularity to his mastery of branding, transforming routine events into spectacles and astute messaging. \u201cHe strikes a deep chord with his aura of clarity and strength, speaks simultaneously to anxieties and aspirations, communicates using emotionally resonant metaphors, understands the power of branding key initiatives to generate a sense of activity and purpose and knows the power of enigmatic silence,\u201d Santosh Desai, a well-known brand consultant, wrote in 2017. Over the years, Mr Modi also sold himself as a cultural icon engaging a diverse people both at home and abroad, cementing his status as an influential leader in Indian politics. A weak opposition and a largely friendly media helped him build his brand. \u201cHe\u2019s pop culture in 70% of this country,\u201d a brand consultant said at a conclave last year. No longer. As results of the general elections show, Brand Modi is beginning to fray. Mr Modi has never underperformed and won less than a majority in all the elections he has fought so far. It has been different this time. Tuesday\u2019s results show that some of the sheen may be wearing off and even Mr Modi is not immune to the vagaries of anti-incumbency. Soutik Biswas, BBC News in Dehli\n\n4,200 mile opposition march 'galvanised party cadres'\n\nSince the July 2023 formation of the opposition INDIA alliance, a grouping of more than two dozen parties, the Modi-led government has been painting it as a ragtag bunch of self-serving leaders out to personally target Mr Modi and destroy the country. While the leaders of the ruling BJP, along with most analysts and pollsters, had for months been predicting an easy win for Mr Modi, the Congress-led opposition block kept emphasising rural distress, inflation and rampant unemployment in its messaging and public meetings. \"The Constitution is in danger\" and the country\u2019s \u201cdemocratic institutions are under attack\u201d under a \u201cdivisive\u201d Mr Modi was their war cry. A 4,200 miles (6,700 km) long march by Rahul Gandhi, a senior leader of the Congress party, that began months before the elections was heavily panned for its timing, but analysts believe it enthused supporters and galvanised party cadres. The opposition also upped its social media reach and aggressively took on the BJP which has for a long time dominated the digital landscape in India. Vineet Khare, BBC World Service in Delhi\n\nWelfare schemes of Modi rivals 'better connect' with voters in southern India\n\nGetty Images Election results were eagerly watched by millions across India\n\nMr Modi's BJP is still struggling to make a major impact in southern India, although its vote share is set to increase. It won 25 seats in Karnataka alone in 2019. But this time it is losing at least 10 seats in the same state to the Congress party. It is on the verge of doubling the four seats it won in Telangana and a couple of seats in Andhra Pradesh because of its alliance with the regional Telugu Desam Party, headed by the IT industry friendly Chandrababu Naidu. In Tamil Nadu, the regional DMK led alliance is on the verge of repeating its 2019 performance of a clean sweep. And in Kerala, the Communist government and the Congress-led front seem to have kept the BJP from the Lok Sabha. In short, the development focused welfare schemes of the non-BJP parties appear to be making a better connect with the aspirations of the voters down South. Imran Qureshi, BBC Hindi in Bangalore\n\nSo what next? Result may force Modi to 'slow down'\n\nMr Modi projected himself as the voice of the Global South \u2013 a leader who acted as a bridge between the developing and the developed world. The Indian PM\u2019s global heft was grounded in the massive support he had at home. He provided a sense of continuity to global leaders and alliances. Mr Modi will now head a coalition government. He is likely to have bipartisan support on foreign policy, but he will have to take allies into confidence before taking crucial decisions that affect global politics.\n\nThat might force him to slow down, and adopt a more consultative decision making policy. So far India has defiantly practised its policy of strategic autonomy in foreign affairs, and that might not change. But what will change is Mr Modi\u2019s ability to take quick decisions on global affairs \u2013 something he often did without consulting his own allies or the opposition.

Adnan Abidi/Reuters\n\nSince assuming power in 2014, Modi has attained levels of popularity not seen in decades, owing to a raft of development and welfare programs, mixed with a strident brand of Hindu nationalism in a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith.\n\nUnder Modi\u2019s leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power, making strides in technology and space. Yet, despite these successes, poverty and youth unemployment persist \u2013 particularly in rural areas \u2013 and the wealth gap has widened.\n\nCritics also say a decade of Modi\u2019s governance has led to growing religious polarization, with Islamophobia marginalizing much of the country\u2019s more than 200 million Muslims, and religious violence flaring up in a nation with a long history of communal tensions.\n\nPolling began on April 19 and ended on June 1. Nearly 1 billion Indians were eligible to vote for 543 seats in the lower house of parliament. The leader of the party that wins a majority will become prime minister and form a ruling government.\n\nModi has set an ambitious target of securing a 400-seat supermajority, with 370 directly controlled by his BJP \u2013 up from 303 in 2019 \u2013 and the others from its National Democratic Alliance.\n\nHis BJP centered its manifesto on job creation and anti-poverty programs, with a focus on women, the poor and farmers. He\u2019s promised to turn India into a developed nation by 2047 and transform the country into a global manufacturing hub.\n\nYet, on the campaign trail, he has been accused of deploying openly divisive rhetoric that has been condemned as Islamophobic, while casting himself as an instrument chosen by God.\n\nModi sparked a row over hate speech when he accused Muslims \u2013 who have been part of India for centuries \u2013 of being \u201cinfiltrators,\u201d and echoing a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country\u2019s Hindu population by deliberately having large families. His BJP released several political videos targeting Muslims, one of which is under investigation by police.\n\nCongress has governed India for much of its independent history, having been instrumental in ending nearly 200 years of British colonial rule. But over the last decade, it has struggled to find relevance \u2013 partly due to a series of corruption scandals and infighting \u2013 unable to break through Modi\u2019s popularity.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the son of the famed Gandhi dynasty, is the face of the party but lost the past two elections to Modi. He is contending once again from the southern state of Kerala and the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh in the north, also India\u2019s most populous.\n\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi shows his ink-marked finger after casting his vote during the sixth phase of Lok Sabha elections, on May 25, 2024 in New Delhi, India. Raj K Raj/Hindustan Times/Sipa/Reuters\n\nOpposition leaders and parties have faced a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year\u2019s election, with many accusing the BJP of using state agencies to stifle opponents.\n\nThe arrest in March of the popular Aam Aadmi Party leader, chief minister of Delhi and staunch Modi critic Arvind Kejriwal sparked protests in the capital and prompted claims of a political \u201cconspiracy\u201d by his party \u2013 claims the BJP has denied.\n\nKejriwal\u2019s release on interim bail last month galvanized the opposition to put up a tough fight against the BJP, uniting a group of political leaders who were once divided over ideological differences.\n\nThe Congress\u2019 manifesto has also been dubbed one of India\u2019s most progressive, pledging \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d and vowing to protect freedom of speech, expression and religious belief espoused in the constitution.\n\nTurnout across all seven phases has slightly dipped from the record highs of 2019, yet India\u2019s general election remains the largest exercise in democracy, with hundreds of millions showing up to determine who will lead the world\u2019s most populous country.",

      "title": "India election live: Opposition party alliance to hold meeting on Wednesday",
      "news": "NEW DELHI/BENGALURU -- Election Commission officials on Tuesday counted ballots cast over India's six-week general election, which closed on June 1.\n\nExit polls conducted by local media on Saturday showed that the alliance led by 73-year-old Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party was likely to win a comfortable majority and secure a third five-year consecutive term.\n\nModi is likely to continue domestic policies focusing on economic reforms and infrastructure development, as well as diplomatic relations as he seeks to establish Indian leadership on the global stage.\n\nThe race was closer than expected and it took longer than in 2019 for Modi to declare the victory. Official results had not come out as of 9:50 p.m. local time.\n\nHere is how the election has unfolded (times are in India Standard Time):\n\n9:05 p.m. Local media say that the opposition INDIA bloc will hold a meeting at 6 p.m. on Wednesday. Earlier, when asked if they have decided to sit in the opposition or there are chances of government formation by INDIA, possibly by wooing back some former allies who are now part of the NDA, Rahul Gandhi said, \"We are going to have a meeting with our INDIA alliance partners [which] I believe is tomorrow and these questions will be raised there and they will answered there.\"\n\nCongress President Mallikarjun Kharge maintained that they can speak about making a majority only after speaking to their alliance partners and those new allies who could join them. \"If I reveal all strategies here, then Modi ji will be [alerted].\"\n\n7:25 p.m. Narendra Modi posted on X: \"People have placed their faith in NDA, for a third consecutive time! This is a historical feat in India's history.\" Local media say he will make a televised address at 8 p.m.\n\n6:13 p.m. At a press briefing held by the opposition Congress party, President Mallikarjun Kharge said, \"The Congress and the India alliance fought elections under many challenges, the government put many obstacles, including freezing of bank accounts. Despite these challenges, people supported us.\"\n\nHe added, \"Our fight hasn't reach the desired destination, [but] for saving democracy and constitution, our border and the people of this country, we will keep fighting. The coming days will be important.\"\n\nRahul Gandhi spoke after, saying, \"This election for India alliance and Congress party didn't fight against a political party only. This was against BJP, institutions, governance structures ... it was a fight against all. All these institutions were captured by Modi, and [Home Minister] Amit Shah. The fight was about saving the constitution.\"\n\nHe continued: \"When they froze our bank accounts, put chief ministers in jail, broke parties, I thought people of India will come together to save the constitution. And I have been proven right.\"\n\n5:10 p.m. Modi wins in his Varanasi constituency in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, according to a post on the Election Commission's website.\n\nBJP supporters celebrate outside the party headquarters in New Delhi on June 4. (Photo by Suzu Takahashi)\n\n4:08 p.m. The benchmark Sensex closed 5.7% lower, slightly recovering from a fall of 7.2% earlier. \"We see Narendra Modi returning as PM but in changed circumstances,\" financial research firm Emkay wrote in a statement. \"The broad direction of the economy is unlikely to change, though factor market reform and privatization are off the table. India is likely to now derate due to higher risk perception.\"\n\n3:49 p.m. Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani is trailing Congress veteran Kishori Lal at the Amethi constituency in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh by more than 100,000 votes, according to the Election Commission. Irani had caused a major upset in the 2019 elections by defeating Rahul Gandhi in Amethi, considered a Gandhi family and Congress stronghold.\n\n12:50 p.m. The early trend shows the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance will easily cross the majority mark of 272 seats needed to form a government but fall short of the landslide predicted by exit polls. As of 12:45 p.m., the NDA is leading races for 290 seats while the opposition INDIA bloc is winning races for 234 seats, according to a local private news channel NDTV.\n\nPeople watches election TV program at a counting centre in New Delhi on June 4. (Photo by Suzu Takahashi)\n\n12:40 p.m. India's stock market plunges further, with the benchmark index Sensex falling 7.26% to hit its lowest point in about six months. Heavy selling has been sparked by fears that the ruling BJP may have to rely on its allies to cross the majority mark, which could in turn slow the government's ability to implement reforms.\n\n10:37 a.m. A BJP spokesperson said it looks unlikely the National Democratic Alliance led by the party will achieve a goal of 400 seats that was often touted by Modi during campaigning. \"That's a fair assessment to say 400 certainly looks distant, but we need to wait until sixth and seventh round of counting,\" said Nalin Kohli. \"BJP and its allies will form the government, that's very clear. We are entitled to, as ... any party is, say this is our target, why should we not have a wish list?\"\n\n9:40 a.m. India's benchmark stock index, the Sensex, tanked 3.0% in the morning after early trends showed that although the BJP and its allies had a lead, the opposition was not very far behind.\n\nThe Sensex had risen 3.4% on Monday on the back of exit polls predicting a comfortable win for the incumbent government, which has spent billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and subsidies to transform India into a manufacturing hub. Investors took profits on Tuesday after the previous day's rise and as the opposition put up a strong fight.\n\nA TV journalist reports from the BJP headquarters in New Delhi on June 4, as workers make breakfast for supporters of the party. (Photo by Suzu Takahashi)\n\nThe BJP's chief spokesperson, Sanju Verma, said: \"We are far ahead -- from noon you will see the lead between NDA (the National Democratic Alliance) and the other side will widen, BJP will cross the important benchmark of 400 seats.\" But the spokesperson of the opposition Congress party, Shama Mohamed, said, \"These are early trends -- we still believe we will win, and you will get to see it around noon.\"\n\n8:56 a.m. Reporters from local media started gathering in front of the ruling BJP's headquarters in central New Delhi at around 7:30 a.m. Right after the counting of ballots began, TV channels started releasing trends, all showing the BJP and its alliance in the lead, as predicted by the exit polls.\n\n8:00 a.m. The Election Commission of India started counting at hundreds of voting stations in each of 36 states and federally governed territories. Most voters cast their ballots using electronic voting machines that allowed them to press a button beside the name and party symbol of a candidate. At counting centers, officials press a \"results\" button to see the total votes for each candidate.\n\nThe India Gate monument in New Delhi on the morning of June 4 as the nation waited for election results. (Photo by Suzu Takahashi)\n\nThe Election Commission said on Monday that 642 million out of the 968 million registered voters had cast ballots. The raw number was higher than in 2019, but the turnout was about 1 percentage point lower than the 67.4% five years ago.\n\nTrends should emerge by noon, and who is forming the next government should become clearer in the afternoon.",

Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to unlawfully purchasing and possessing a firearm while abusing drugs, which is against federal law.

At stake are 543 seats in the Lok Sabha \u2013 the lower house of India\u2019s parliament.\n\nLeads so far suggest a far closer contest than exit polls had predicted. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party is projected to emerge as the single largest party, but could fall short of a majority on its own. The alliance it leads is still expected to cross the halfway mark of 272 seats.\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party, is performing better than exit polls had projected.\n\nHere is how the main two alliances are doing, according to the latest updates from the ECI.\n\nHere is how the the BJP and Congress are performing on their own.\n\nIndia election results map\n\nThe map below represents the 543 seats in India\u2019s lower house of parliament. The winning party/alliance will be shaded as results are announced.\n\nWhy does the map look like that?\n\nEach hexagon represents one seat, so densely populated but geographically small constituencies are shown equally with large districts to better reflect the democratic power in parliament. The geographical map is shown below for reference.\n\nWhich two big alliances are facing off?\n\nNational Democratic Alliance (NDA):\n\nThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), comprises more than three dozen parties and is expected, by exit polls, to win a majority in the general election. Modi, 73, who has been in power since 2014, is seeking a third term.\n\nIndian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA):\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Indian National Congress (INC) party, is a group of more than two dozen political outfits hoping to remove the BJP\u2019s Hindu majoritarian government.\n\nHow does the vote count work?\n\nSince 2004, India has used electronic voting machines (EVMs) instead of paper ballots.\n\nThese machines, which are not connected to the internet, have been sealed and stored in a strongroom in the parliamentary constituency.\n\nOn the day of counting, the EVMs are taken out and unsealed in the presence of representatives from all participating political parties.\n\nWhat time will vote counting start and end?\n\nCounting for all constituencies will begin at 8am local time (02:30 GMT) on Tuesday, June 4 with most results expected to be in by the early evening.\n\nSeven phases of voting\n\nAn estimated 969 million people were registered to vote in the world\u2019s largest democratic exercise.\n\nTo facilitate the process, the voting took place over seven phases from April 19 to June 1.\n\nHow is the government formed?\n\nThere are 543 directly elected seats in the national assembly called the Lok Sabha, and two seats are nominated by the president. To form the parliament, the winning party or alliance must have 272 seats. The prime minister is elected by the parliament as the leader of the house.\n\nWho is in India\u2019s current parliament?\n\nWith 37 percent vote share in the 2019 election, the right-wing BJP won 303 of 543 seats in the lower house of parliament.

Exit poll projections may not always be accurate.\n\nThe party or coalition that wins at least 272 seats out of 543 forms the government.\n\nMarkets reacted euphorically to exit polls predicting an emphatic victory for the BJP, with key stock benchmarks, the Nifty 50 and the Sensex, gaining more than 3% and hitting record highs on Monday.\n\nEarlier Monday, the Nifty 50 closed the day at 23,263.90 after reaching a record high of 23,338.70, while the Sensex closed at 76,468.78 after hitting 76,738.89.\n\nHowever, as vote counting continued on Tuesday, shares of both indexes plunged by about 7% in the early afternoon, as early projections suggested a closer-than-expected contest between the BJP-led NDA and the Congress-led I.N.D.I.A bloc. Year-to-date, both benchmarks were lower by more than 1% at mid-day, wiping out gains from earlier this year, according to Factset data.\n\nThis was the world's largest democratic exercise with almost a billion registered voters. Voting, which started on April 19, was spread over seven phases and more than six weeks.",

Unlike cryogenic engines that require heavy tanks to hold pressurized liquid hydrogen and oxygen at very low temperatures, semi-cryogenic engines replace the liquid hydrogen with refined kerosene. As a result, such engines require lesser storage space and normal temperatures, allowing for increased payload capacity as well as higher thrust.\n\nRelated: India makes breakthrough by test-firing new 3D-printed rocket engine (photo)\n\nThursday's launch of the Agnibaan Sorted (short for Suborbital Technology Demonstrator), which is designed to ferry up to 660 pounds (300 kilograms) of payload into a 435-mile (700-kilometer) orbit, was the startup's fifth attempt at the mission. Previous efforts were aborted due to technical issues, including one earlier this week that was canceled just five seconds before scheduled launch.\n\nOn Thursday, the mission lifted off from the startup's launchpad at the Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota on India's southeastern coast. The two-minute flight achieved an altitude of five miles (eight kilometers) before splashing down in the Bay of Bengal. \"All the mission objectives of this controlled vertical ascent flight were met and performance was nominal,\" the startup said in a post on X .\n\n\"This is the culmination of 1000s of hours of reviews and hard work by the team,\" Srinath Ravichandran, the co-founder and CEO of Agnikul Cosmos, added in the news release.

      "title": "Modi set to remain India's PM but fails to win by landslide",
      "news": "Supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party celebrate Narendra Modi's victory in New Delhi on June 4. MONEY SHARMA / AFP\n\nNarendra Modi, 73, is set to remain at India's helm, but with a serious warning from the electorate. After 10 years of uninterrupted power, the prime minister won the parliamentary elections on Tuesday, June 4, with a narrow majority, at the end of a six-week marathon election. The results are currently being consolidated. Some 642 million Indians turned out to vote, braving the country's heatwave.\n\nModi matches his illustrious predecessor, Jawaharlal Nehru, the prime minister of independence, elected three times. But his victory falls short of expectations. Modi had asked Indians to give him 370 seats, 400 with his coalition, i.e. two-thirds of the majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, required to amend the Constitution. He has failed, obtaining with his allies around 290 seats, barely more than the simple majority, set at 272 seats, despite his party's, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), fierce campaigning on the ground and social media, and despite his personal involvement. The omnipresent prime minister held 206 public rallies and gave 80 interviews during the six-week campaign. Defenders of democracy and secularism can rest assured that Modi will not have the means to make major constitutional changes.\n\nRead more Subscribers only BJP election campaign in India revolves around cult of Modi\n\nThe state of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous and strategic one with 80 MPs, illustrates the shift in opinion and the crystallization of anger. Modi had counted on the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya to win by a landslide. But on Tuesday morning, the opposition was in the lead, seemingly close to defeating the BJP, represented by the fanatical monk Yogi Adityanath.\n\nThe BJP is retreating to its strongholds in the Hindi-speaking belt, in the north and west of the country, and is barely making inroads in the previously impregnable south and east. However, the gains made in these regions do not compensate for losses elsewhere.\n\nUpset\n\nOver the past few weeks, many pockets of discontent had been heard on the ground. You just had to listen: farmers, unemployed young people, the poor stunned by inflation, Muslims stigmatized by Modi, those relegated by growth, Ladakhis on hunger strike, all were expressing their disappointment with the prime minister. The Modi magic is over. In his constituency of Benares, he won by a narrow margin.\n\nRead more The Modi decade: Economic boom and democratic decline\n\nFor the opposition and the Congress, this could be the start of a process of reconquest, if they know how to remain united. For the first time since 2014, the Nehru-Gandhi party, which governed the country for a quarter of a century before going under, succeeded in rallying a grand coalition of around 30 parties, even if there were still around 100 constituencies where candidates were in competition. The Congress Party's strongman, Rahul Gandhi, finally assumed the role of leader while avoiding the trap of arrogance toward his partners, as the Congress had not nominated a candidate for the post of prime minister. Finally, the opposition chose campaign themes that resonated with the concerns of the poor and modest: social justice and equality.\n\nYou have 59.74% of this article left to read.

      "news": "Rural U.S. health care is in a crisis. We went to a Georgia town to see how people there experience it\n\ntoggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR\n\nImagine you\u2019re having a heart attack and the nearest hospital is almost an hour away.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nThat\u2019s a situation some of the 46 million Americans who live in rural areas could find themselves in, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They\u2019re more likely to die than someone who lives in an urban area due to having limited access to emergency services and specialized care.\n\nMorning Edition wanted to see first-hand what this challenge looks like, so we visited Elberton, Georgia, which bills itself as the \u201cGranite Capital of the World.\u201d The town with fewer than 5,000 people sits a couple of hours east of Atlanta near the South Carolina border.\n\n\n\nCicadas chirped loudly as we made our way inside the Medical Center of Elberton\n\nOffice manager Brooke McDowell said they don\u2019t quiet down, not even at night.\n\nThe center is officially designated by the government as a Rural Health Clinic, which means it can get more money for treating people with Medicare and Medicaid. About 70% of the center\u2019s patients fit that profile.\n\ntoggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR\n\nThe clinic offers services like primary care, gynecology, X-rays and chronic disease management. Dr. Dan McAvoy, who sat with us for an interview, said the clinic has six physicians and two nurse practitioners.\n\n\u201cProbably the most common things we handle are hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke,\u201d McAvoy said.\n\nIf not for this clinic, he said, most people would have to go to cities that sit 30 to 40 miles away. That can be a barrier for some patients, McAvoy said, because they don\u2019t have transportation available to them.\n\nBeyond that, many rural hospitals have been closing across the country. From 2010 to 2019, 114 closed or cut key services across the U.S., according to health policy nonprofit KFF. Closures are concentrated in states like Georgia that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, the joint state and federal program that provides health coverage to low-income people.\n\nIn Georgia specifically, 18 of its 30 rural hospitals are at risk of closing due to financial issues, according to a February 2024 report from health consulting firm Chartis. The report also found that about half of all rural hospitals in the U.S. are operating in the red.\n\n\n\nFor 72-year-old Sylvia Chapman, this clinic means access to health care near her home \u2014 and a chance to tell jokes\n\n\u201cWhy do melons get married?\u201d she asked us and waited for a guess. \u201cBecause they cantaloupe.\u201d\n\nChapman retired after 34 and a half years in public service and moved to Elberton seven years ago. She\u2019s been a patient at the clinic for six years and she likes it here. \u201cThey let me tell my jokes. They tolerate me, so that\u2019s not bad,\u201d she said.\n\nShe\u2019s had a couple of strokes, and every now and then, she needs to see specialists. The medical center helps her with referrals, and she likes her doctor. She\u2019s also able to visit the nearby Elbert Memorial Hospital.\n\nWhere would she go if this clinic wasn\u2019t here?\n\nAthens, Georgia, takes her about 50 minutes to get to, or the town of Anderson, which is slightly closer but across the state line into South Carolina.\n\nWould she skip care if what she needed was farther away?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to come here,\u201d she said, adding that she would travel farther if needed. But the headache would be her husband\u2019s because she rarely does any of the driving. \u201cWhenever I tell my husband I have an appointment, he says, \u2018Where is it?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s relieved to hear when they\u2019re in town.\n\n\u201cYou need this. You don\u2019t need to get rid of this place,\u201d she said, of the Medical Center of Elberton. \u201cYou have too many people in the waiting room, so you know it's a needed place. Very convenient for the locals.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe local need is highlighted in Dr. Jonathan Poon\u2019s schedule: It\u2019s early May and he\u2019s already booked out until July\n\nIt\u2019s not a good feeling, Poon said, because he doesn\u2019t want to be inaccessible to his patients.\n\n\u201cWe will see, you know, our patients walk in without appointments any day. We'll work them in,\u201d Poon said. \u201cBut it's just not a good feeling when someone calls and they have to wait for a month or more for appointments.\u201d\n\nIt's a balance, Poon said, because he wishes he could spend more time with patients.\n\ntoggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR\n\n\u201cBut the more time we spend with patients means the fewer patients you can spend time with,\u201d Poon said.\n\n\u201cMaybe I can\u2019t clone myself, but if we can have more providers to help see our patients who have the same passion we do, that would be a great start,\u201d Poon said.\n\nThat will be a challenge the clinic will have to grapple with sooner than later.\n\n\u201cParticularly, as some of us are aging, there\u2019s going to be a need in the next few years for more physicians,\u201d McAvoy said.\n\nBut it\u2019s difficult to get doctors to move out this way.\n\n\u201cWe have to find someone who likes the lifestyle of living in a small community and enjoys outdoors things, such as fishing and hunting,\u201d McAvoy said.\n\n\n\nPoon told us that one of the medical services most lacking here is mental health care\n\nPoon said he and other doctors here have noticed mental health needs have become more of an issue over the past few years, but the clinic is limited in what it can do.\n\n\u201cWe just don't have really a stable mental health program here,\u201d Poon said. \u201cAnd so we'd like to, you know, ultimately offer that ourselves. But there's no real, kind of, direct way for rural health to offer that.\u201d\n\nGeorgia ranked 49th in access to mental health care and first in prevalence of mental illness in the 2023 report from Mental Health America, a nonprofit that works to provide resources and advocates for more access.\n\ntoggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR\n\nIn Atlanta, we asked Kim Jones, the executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness for Georgia, why access is such an issue here.\n\nShe said that federal law requires insurance companies to provide mental health care at the same level that they do for physical health. Her organization has found that isn\u2019t happening in Georgia.\n\nBut it\u2019s also something people are uncomfortable talking about.\n\n\u201cI think there's just this overall stigma that mental health is maybe more so based on your behavior and your beliefs and pull up your bootstraps and just get over it. Versus it truly being a physical chemical imbalance in your brain at times,\u201d Jones said.\n\nWith access overall in Georgia already a challenge, Jones said rural towns and counties fare even worse.\n\n\u201cThere are a significant number of counties here in Georgia that have no mental health providers at all,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so, even when we look at trying to expand telehealth, we have areas that are not covered by the internet.\u201d\n\n\n\nDespite the challenge of accessing health care, Sylvia Chapman tells us why this small town life appeals to her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to fight traffic in the metro areas,\u201d she said. She\u2019s enjoying her retirement, playing games and puzzles on her phone. She and her husband will celebrate 47 years of marriage later in August.\n\nShe\u2019ll keep coming to this clinic for her health care\n\nShe\u2019ll also be watching the November election.\n\nAs someone who spent her working life helping Georgians get Medicaid, she recognizes the importance of health care as an issue.\n\n\u201cPeople are deciding whether to buy groceries or buy medicines. And that's the same problem we had back in the seventies and eighties,\u201d Chapman said, adding that how people vote in November will be \u201cvery important\u201d in deciding if Americans continue to face that challenge.\n\n",

      "title": "This is the world\u2019s best investment",
      "news": "is a senior correspondent and head writer for Vox\u2019s Future Perfect section and has worked at Vox since 2014. He is particularly interested in global health and pandemic prevention, anti-poverty efforts, economic policy and theory, and conflicts about the right way to do philanthropy.\n\nA young girl volunteers to help a health worker demonstrate to bednet recipients in Ambowuha, Antsokia Woreda, the correct way to use the nets during the distribution of Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLIN) to prevent malaria, the country\u2019s biggest killer disease.\n\nThe world spent about $97.9 billion in the years since 1994 trying to develop new tools to fight infectious diseases in poor countries. That includes things like vaccines, treatments, diagnosis tools, and preventative tools like bed nets for diseases like malaria.\n\nThat sounds like a lot of money, and it is. But Policy Cures Research, the organization that came up with that number, also tried to estimate the benefit that this research generated. They got a dollar figure there, too: $49.7 trillion. The full investment will avert, the report finds, about 40.7 million total deaths between the years 2000 and 2040.\n\nThese are big claims that deserve scrutiny. But they hold up.\n\nThe finding is particularly important at a moment when key institutions like the World Health Organization, the vaccine fund Gavi, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria are all conducting fundraising drives, ones that world leaders have yet to respond to with adequate investment. The resistance is understandable (these are big sums) but short-sighted.\n\nThere are massive gains to be won by investing more to develop cures, treatments, and vaccines for the world\u2019s deadliest infectious diseases. We just have to do it.\n\nHow did they determine how many lives have been saved?\n\nThe study focused on what Policy Cures calls \u201cneglected diseases.\u201d That means infectious diseases that primarily affect the developing world. Their burden is enormous. Respiratory infections and tuberculosis were responsible for 153 million years of healthy life lost in the year 2019. That\u2019s about double the injury toll of car accidents worldwide.\n\nThe report found 183 new technologies targeting these diseases approved between 1999 and 2023. It hired an outside firm, Avenir Health, which used data from the Global Burden of Disease study to model how much they have cut death and disease to date. In some cases, the authors also had to extrapolate. Some technologies, like the RTS,S and R21 malaria vaccines, only won backing from the World Health Organization in the past couple years, so the authors estimated the benefit these will have if/when they\u2019re rolled out.\n\nIn total, they estimate that these technologies will wind up saving 2.47 billion years of life (after adjusting for lives saved in the future). That\u2019s about 40.7 million total lives saved. It\u2019s a gargantuan, gargantuan total.\n\nToday, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nPutting a price tag on a human life\n\nCalculating ROI for global health investments is tricky. First you need to know what the investments cost. The total cost spent on these technologies to date is $97.9 billion. Pushing through promising tools currently \u201cin the pipeline\u201d that could be rolled out before 2040 will cost another $24.8 billion, for a total cost of $122.7 billion.\n\nThen, putting a dollar value on the benefits accrued requires making some judgment calls.\n\nThe bulk of the benefits come from saving lives and preventing illness. To calculate an ROI number, you have to put a monetary value on those saved lives and prevented illnesses, a value you can then compare to the upfront investment cost. The report values each year of healthy life saved at $19,985. Multiply that by 2.47 billion life years saved by these technologies, and you get about $49.4 trillion.\n\nAdd in their estimates of the general economic benefits communities accrue because workers and dependents are less burdened by disease ($269.8 billion), and you get the $49.7 trillion in total benefits the report finds, or $405 for every dollar invested.\n\nEven that ROI is arguably an undercount.\n\nThe $19,985 per life year figure that drives 99 percent of these benefits is a variant on what\u2019s known as the \u201cvalue of a statistical life,\u201d and calculating it is among the most complex and controversial tasks in economics.\n\nTypically, the value is estimated by measuring what individuals are willing to pay to reduce their risk of dying. The idea is that people\u2019s actual spending gives a truer sense of their feelings than, say, polling them would. But people in poor countries are willing to pay less than people in rich countries, for the obvious reason that they have less money. This approach tends to conclude that lives in poor countries are literally worth less. Indeed, the Policy Cures report uses smaller values of a statistical life for poor countries.\n\nIn a subsection, they generate estimates where every life counts equally. Using a value for the US ($12.3 million) and applying it to every human being equally, they get an ROI of over $9,000 per dollar invested \u2014 which the report rejects as \u201cpotentially unrealistic and harmful to the project\u2019s credibility.\u201d\n\nI think that $9,000 figure is more realistic. Setting a lower value makes some sense for, say, the government of Nigeria; the statistic gives policymakers a sense of how much their citizens are willing to pay to save their lives, in situations where they will be the ones paying.\n\nBut poor country governments are not the main funders of malaria vaccine research. The funders are governments and foundations in rich countries \u2014 groups in the global north, in other words. Those groups should be valuing every life equally, and highly.\n\nWe need to spend now to make these gains possible\n\nThe bulk of these billions of life years have already been saved, but some are yet to come. The report estimates malaria vaccines will save about 370 million life years from now until 2040. But malaria vaccines have only barely begun rolling out. The first vaccine, RTS,S, took decades to be released, and even now advocates are raising the alarm that we don\u2019t have enough money to fund a full rollout to every child who needs a vaccine.\n\nThese vaccines might save 370 million life years, but they might not. We need to invest in getting them to people who need them.\n\nThis is an immensely hopeful report. But it\u2019s a report that also serves as a call to arms. Rich countries need to get their act together, fast, or this opportunity will slip through our fingers, with poor children in Africa and South Asia paying the price.",

Protein pacing means consuming protein at regular intervals, while intermittent fasting involves alternating between fasting and eating periods.\n\nA recent study suggests that combining these two approaches may lead to superior weight loss and better gut health and metabolic responses compared to a simple calorie-restricted diet.\n\nWhile this novel diet approach showed significant benefits, this study was small, and research on this type of diet is limited.\n\nExperts recommend prioritizing a healthy gut microbiome and seeking personalized weight management advice from licensed doctors or dietitians. A recent study published in Nature Communications investigated the effects of two low-calorie diets on the gut microbiome and metabolomic profiles of individuals with overweight or obesity. This study built upon data and samples from a small randomized controlled trial that was published in Obesity in 2023. The initial trial compared the benefits of two diets over 8 weeks: a simple caloric restriction following approach versus a unique regimen combining intermittent fasting and protein pacing. Protein pacing involves consuming protein at consistent intervals throughout the day, while intermittent fasting alternates periods of fasting and eating. Both the caloric restriction and intermittent fasting and protein pacing diets led to significant changes, but the intermittent fasting and protein pacing group showed greater reductions in total body fat, visceral fat, weight, and desire to eat. Contributing to the original study findings, the new analysis suggests that the intermittent fasting and protein pacing diet could significantly reduce gastrointestinal symptoms and promote gut microbes associated with a leaner body type. Additionally, the intermittent fasting and protein pacing diet may increase beneficial proteins (cytokines) and amino acid byproducts in the blood associated with weight and fat loss. The study was funded by Isagenix International LLC, which provided the meal replacements, beverages, and supplements used in the trial.\n\nContinuous calorie restriction vs. intermittent fasting and protein-pacing In this study, Arizona State University researchers and their colleagues analyzed data from a clinical trial involving 41 overweight or obese individuals. Participants were randomly assigned to follow one of two diets for 8 weeks: continuous calorie restriction or intermittent fasting and protein-pacing. The caloric restriction diet primarily consisted of whole foods, while the intermittent fasting and protein pacing diet combined intermittent fasting with protein pacing, including whole foods and supplement shakes and bars. Both diets reduced participants\u2019 total fat, carbohydrate, sodium, sugar, and calorie intake by approximately 40% from their baseline levels, resulting in an average 1,000-calorie deficit. The intermittent fasting and protein pacing diet involved 5\u20136 days of 4 daily meals for women, and five meals a day for men, spaced 4 hours apart, each containing 25\u201350 grams of protein, and included a 36\u201360-hour weekly modified fasting period with 350\u2013550 calories per day. Compared to the caloric restriction diet, the intermittent fasting and protein pacing diet significantly reduced sugar while increasing dietary fiber and protein. Despite many differences, the diets were matched for calorie intake and calories burned through physical activity. Participants self-reported their dietary intake daily, along with daily monitoring by researchers and weekly dietitian meetings. Stool and blood samples were collected before, mid-intervention, and after the intervention to assess gut microbiome, cytokines , and metabolomic profiles. At the same intervals, participants completed a 15-question gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS). The study authors compared these markers between the two groups to identify any significant differences in response to the two diets.\n\nBenefits for weight management, gut health on both diets The initial study trial reported that both groups saw significant improvements, however, the intermittent fasting and protein pacing group witnessed greater improvements in their: weight\n\ntotal fat mass\n\nvisceral fat mass\n\ndesire to eat\n\nfat-free mass percentage. The current analysis revealed significant changes in gut response to both diet interventions, which might help account for the intermittent fasting and protein pacing diet\u2019s observed weight management advantages. Participants in the intermittent fasting and protein pacing group experienced: notable improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms\n\na more substantial shift in gut microbiota\n\na greater overall change from baseline compared to the caloric restriction group. The researchers noted increases in specific gut bacteria in the intermittent fasting and protein pacing group, particularly Christensenellaceae, which is associated with reduced visceral fat, improved fat oxidation, and enhanced metabolic health. Additionally, intermittent fasting and protein pacing led to increased circulating amino acid metabolites favoring fat oxidation and cytokines linked to lipolysis (fat breakdown), weight loss, inflammation, and immune response. Medical News Today spoke with Eliza Whitaker, MS, RDN, a registered dietitian and medical nutrition advisor at Dietitian Insights, who was not involved in the study and described the significance of the intermittent fasting and protein pacing diet outcomes. \u201cIncreases in amino acid-derived metabolites in participants\u2019 gut microbiome following an intermittent fasting protein pacing regimen can support energy, protein synthesis, and the proliferation of hepatocytes [involved in nutrient metabolism],\u201d she told us. While the intermittent fasting and protein pacing showed more significant benefits overall, the caloric restriction diet notably displayed an increase in metabolites associated with a longevity-related metabolic pathway. The study also revealed a correlation between individuals\u2019 gut microbiome composition and their level of weight loss in response to the diet interventions.\n\nHow intermittent fasting and protein pacing may improve gut, metabolic health MNT also spoke with Alexandra Filingeri, DCN, RDN, a registered dietitian and doctor of clinical nutrition who was not involved with the study, about potential reasons why an intermittent fasting and protein pacing resulted in superior gut and metabolic health outcomes. She said that \u201c[b]acteria that reside in the human gastrointestinal tract produce bioactive metabolites known to influence health.\u201d Filingeri explained: \u201cThe bacterial environment within the gut shifts based on its specific inputs. Essentially altering caloric consumption, fiber source and amino acid availability can influence the type of bacteria in our gut. In the [intermittent fasting and protein pacing], protein availability, spacing between meals and fasting windows were shown to have positive influence on microbial species.\u201d Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS, a physician-scientist at the RUSH Institute for Healthy Aging, Rush University System for Health, who was not involved in the study, provided additional insight. Holland noted that while it is difficult to pinpoint precisely why the intermittent fasting and protein pacing diet resulted in more significant beneficial outcomes than the caloric restriction diet, \u201cthe combination of intermittent fasting and meal replacement with protein shakes may be key factors.\u201d \u201cThe intermittent dietary input periods and the high protein content of the shakes likely promoted gut microbiome competition. Furthermore, the fiber in the shakes contribute[d] to better blood sugar control, reduced cholesterol absorption (leading to lower LDL levels and improved cardiovascular health), and enhanced general gut health, among other benefits.\u201d \u2013 Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS \u201cThis is not to say that calorie restriction alone wasn\u2019t beneficial; it just wasn\u2019t as impactful,\u201d he emphasized.",

      "title": "The 10 Best Water Additives for Your Health",
      "news": "Many Americans don't drink enough water daily, which can lead to dehydration and other health issues, such as constipation and high blood pressure.\n\nWhile it's clear that maintaining optimal hydration is key for overall health, some people find it challenging to meet their daily water needs because they don't like the taste of plain water.\n\nFortunately, a number of ingredients can be added to water to enhance its taste and health benefits.\n\n\n\n1. Lemon\n\nfcafotodigital / Getty Images\n\nLemon slices and lemon juice are amongst the most popular water additives, and for good reason. Not only do lemons add a tangy, citrusy flavor to water, which can increase your water consumption, but they also provide several nutrients and beneficial plant compounds.\n\nFor example, lemons are an excellent source of vitamin C, which is critical for immune function and has powerful antioxidant effects. Just two tablespoons (tbsp) of lemon juice provides 13% of your daily needs for vitamin C.\n\nAdding lemon slices or lemon juice to your water can help you maintain optimal vitamin C levels, which may reduce your risk of developing many health conditions, including heart disease.\n\n\n\nTry squeezing fresh lemon juice into your water and combining lemon slices with other water additives, like mint, for a refreshing way to increase your fluid intake.\n\n\n\n2. Tart Cherry Juice\n\nlisaaMC / Getty Images\n\nTart cherry juice has a sweet and slightly tart flavor perfect for jazzing up plain water. Adding tart cherry juice to water may be an especially smart choice for athletes and gym-goers looking for an easy and delicious way to support muscle recovery.\n\nResearch suggests that drinking tart cherry juice could facilitate muscle recovery and reduce delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), a type of common muscle injury that causes symptoms like swelling, pain, and stiffness after exercise. Tart cherry juice contains anti-inflammatory compounds, including anthocyanins, which may help reduce muscle damage and DOMS.\n\nOne review found that drinking tart cherry juice effectively reduced DOMS, decreased inflammation markers after exercise, and accelerated muscle recovery.\n\n3. Ginger Slices or Ginger Juice\n\nby vesi_127 / Getty Images\n\nIf you like ginger tea, ginger slices or ginger juice could become your new go-to water additive. Ginger's warm, spicy flavor pairs well with other water additives like lemon juice.\n\nGinger contains antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances, including shogaols, gingerols, and zingerone. These compounds combat inflammation by inhibiting certain proinflammatory pathways and decreasing levels of inflammatory proteins such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1).\n\nIn addition to reducing inflammation, ginger compounds have pain-reducing and muscle-relaxing effects, and some research suggests that ginger treatments may be a helpful way to reduce period-related pain. Try adding ginger juice or ginger slices to your water or making ginger tea during your period to soothe cramps.\n\n4. Magnesium Powder\n\njayk7 / Getty Images\n\nMagnesium is a mineral required for blood sugar regulation, muscle contraction, blood pressure maintenance, and many other critical body processes. Magnesium supplements can help improve overall health and may be especially beneficial for those with hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), and several other health concerns.\n\nMagnesium supplements are available in many forms, including powdered products, some of which are flavored. Adding magnesium powder to your water can benefit health in several ways, including reducing blood sugar and blood pressure and improving constipation.\n\n\n\nTry adding magnesium powder to your water for an easy and effective way to boost your health.\n\n\n\n5. Pomegranate Juice\n\nRazvan Dinu / Getty Images\n\nPomegranates and pomegranate juice are rich in protective plant compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, such as anthocyanins, ellagitannins, and organic acids. Studies show that drinking pomegranate juice regularly could benefit heart health by reducing blood pressure and may support cognitive function by lowering inflammation and enhancing memory.\n\nA 2019 study of 60 people with type 2 diabetes found that the participants who drank 200 mL of pomegranate juice daily for six weeks experienced significant reductions in their blood pressure levels compared to a control group.\n\n\n\nAdd a splash of pomegranate juice to your water for a heart-healthy way to stay hydrated.\n\n\n\n6. Electrolyte Powders\n\nglobalmoments / Getty Images\n\nElectrolyte powders are dietary supplements that typically contain sodium, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and chloride, minerals essential to health. Adding electrolyte powders to water can help optimize hydration status, especially for those who are losing fluids and electrolytes through sweat, such as athletes and people working in hot environments. Electrolyte powders can also benefit people experiencing fluid loss through diarrhea or vomiting.\n\nElectrolyte powders come in many flavors, but it's important to note that some contain high amounts of added sugar. If you'd like to limit your added sugar intake, choose electrolyte powders sweetened with natural sugar alternatives, like monk fruit or stevia.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Mint\n\nRouzes / Getty Images\n\nMint leaves can add a refreshing flavor and aroma to your water that may be particularly helpful when you're feeling nauseated. Studies show that simply smelling mint could help reduce nausea and vomiting in certain populations, including pregnant women.\n\nTry combining mint leaves and ginger juice or sliced ginger in your water for additional anti-nausea benefits. Ginger is known to have anti-nausea effects and may add additional health benefits to your water.\n\n\n\n8. Orange and Grapefruit Slices and Juice\n\nElena Zaretskaya / Getty Images\n\nCitrus fruits, like oranges and grapefruits, are packed with flavor and can help make your water more pleasant to drink. They are also high in health-promoting compounds like polyphenols, such as naringin and ferulic acid. Boosting your intake of polyphenol-rich foods could support cellular health, improve longevity, and reduce your risk of common health conditions like heart disease and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nAdd a few slices of orange or grapefruit to your water or freeze orange or grapefruit juice in ice trays for a delicious way to keep your water cool while adding a punch of citrusy flavor.\n\n\n\n9. Hibiscus\n\nsimonkr / Getty Images\n\nHibiscus tea has a fruity and slightly tart taste and can be enjoyed hot or cold. Infusing your water with loose-leaf hibiscus or hibiscus teabags can give your drink a beautiful ruby-red color while enhancing its health benefits.\n\nHibiscus tea is rich in anthocyanins, which have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the body. Studies show that drinking hibiscus tea could reduce blood pressure and decrease markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP)\n\nTry sipping on chilled hibiscus water on a hot day or unwinding with a cup of hot hibiscus tea at night.\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Green Tea\n\nElena Fedorina / Getty Images\n\nGreen tea is another type of tea that can greatly benefit your water. Like hibiscus tea, green tea can be enjoyed hot or cold and is delicious paired with other water additives, like ginger and lemon.\n\nGreen tea is a concentrated source of polyphenol antioxidants, including catechins like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). EGCG has powerful cellular-protective and anti-inflammatory effects and is one of the most well-studied compounds in green tea. Because of its high levels of EGCG and other protective compounds, drinking green tea regularly may reduce your risk of health conditions like heart disease, certain cancers, and even depression.\n\nHow Much Water Should You Drink Per Day?\n\nYour hydration needs depend on factors like the environment in which you live, activity levels, body weight, and pregnancy and breastfeeding status. Some people, such as pregnant people, people who live or work in hot climates, and people who are very active, require more water than the average person.\n\nWhile hydration needs vary, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends that adult women and men consume 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) and 15 cups (3.7 liters) of water daily, respectively.\n\nMost people can maintain their hydration status by letting their thirst dictate their fluid consumption. You can also assess your hydration level by the color of your urine. Generally speaking, your urine should be pale and yellowish, like light straw. Darker-colored urine may indicate dehydration.\n\n\n\nOther Ways To Boost Your Hydration\n\nIn addition to drinking plenty of water throughout your day, there are a few other ways to maintain optimal hydration.\n\nChoosing hydrating foods (high in water), like fruits and vegetables, is an easy and nutritious way to meet part of your daily water needs.\n\nAdditionally, cutting back on foods and drinks that contribute to dehydration, such as foods high in added salt and alcohol, can help keep you hydrated.\n\n\n\nA Quick Review\n\nIf you struggle to stay hydrated, adding certain ingredients, like fruits, fruit juice, and electrolyte powders, to your water could help you increase your fluid intake.\n\nTry some of the healthy water additives like lemon, ginger, or mint for an easy way to boost the flavor and health benefits of plain water.",

      "title": "Baldwin, Moore introduce bill to make mental health services more affordable for new moms",
      "news": "When the Wisconsin Maternal Mortality Review Team examines the state\u2019s pregnancy-related deaths, the cause is often behavioral health conditions. In such cases, every death is preventable.\n\nIt\u2019s an ongoing crisis that often goes unspoken. Between 2016 and 2017, more than half of all Wisconsin pregnancy-related deaths were the result of mental health conditions, including suicide, substance use disorders and overdoses.\n\nRelated:Pregnant and postpartum women in Wisconsin don't get enough mental health care. Here's what's happening to change that.\n\nRelated:Why is the Black infant mortality rate in Wisconsin still three times higher than the white rate?\n\nIt\u2019s not just a problem in Wisconsin. Each year, 38 states across the United States, including Wisconsin, submit maternal mortality data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And, overwhelmingly, each year, mental health conditions are the most common underlying.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be this way, say Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Rep. Gwen Moore of Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re really coming up short in terms of supporting the mental health needs of new and expecting mothers, and we\u2019re seeing the impacts,\u201d Baldwin said.\n\nThat\u2019s why, along with other federal Democratic lawmakers, they\u2019ve introduced the federal bill called the Mental Health and Making Access More Affordable (MAMA) Act. This prospective legislation aims to expand access to services for mental health and substance use disorders during pregnancy and postpartum.\n\nCost is the top barrier to receiving mental health help. Democrats say their new bill reduces barrier.\n\nThe Mental Health and MAMA Act would remove copayments, coinsurance and deductibles for pregnant and postpartum patients seeking services for mental health and substance use disorders up to one year following childbirth.\n\nThe bill applies only to specific types of insurance \u2014 commercial and governmental insurance plans, including Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) \u2014 that already cover such services. The bill does not require insurance companies that don\u2019t already do so to add behavioral health coverage, Moore said.\n\nIt builds off continuity of care requirements outlined in the No Surprises Act, enacted in 2020 by Congress. That law protects pregnant patients covered under group and individual health plans from getting surprise medical bills, which could happen if an insurer removes a pregnant patient\u2019s current provider from their network. But the timeframe for these protections is limited. The Mental Health and MAMA Act would extend it to one year postpartum.\n\nResearch from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) shows the No. 1 reason why people do not seek mental health treatment is cost. Wisconsin-specific data backs that up, with half of the state's mothers reporting they're impacted by financial insecurity.\n\nAnother main reason why perinatal patients \u2014 the timeframe that encompasses one year prior to pregnancy through two years following childbirth \u2014 don\u2019t receive mental health treatment is the lingering stigma, according to the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health and SAMHSA data. Many with mental health concerns fear their friends and family's opinion about them would change if they learned they were seeking help, and many worry about the consequences of expressing thoughts of self-harm or harming their babies to a health care provider\n\nMoore and Baldwin say the Mental Health and MAMA Act hits on the two factors of cost and stigma, and the bill can go a long way in encouraging more people to seek help.\n\nIn Wisconsin, women of color make up one-quarter of all births, but nearly half of all pregnancy-related deaths\n\nThose who are the most vulnerable to mental health and substance use concerns during pregnancy also tend to have the least access to care. It\u2019s a point of frustration for Moore, who has spent her political career working on international women\u2019s issues.\n\n\u201cOnce I got involved in international work and international women's issues, it was embarrassing for me to see the high maternal mortality rates in the United States,\u201d Moore said.\n\nThe numbers in Wisconsin speak for themselves.\n\nCombined, Black, Asian and Hispanic mothers comprise just one-quarter of all births in Wisconsin, but they account for nearly half of its pregnancy-related deaths, according to the latest comprehensive report from the state.\n\nBlack women are more likely than women of other races to experience perinatal depression. For example, nearly 30% of Wisconsin\u2019s Black mothers have depression during pregnancy, compared to 17% of white mothers, according to the 2018-19 Wisconsin Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Previous data shows the depression rates for mothers, regardless of race, are climbing each year.\n\nAnd when struggling with depression and anxiety, people are more prone to engage in risky behaviors. Between 2016 and 2019, nearly half of all maternal mortalities in Wisconsin were the result of overdoses. Depression and anxiety are often powerful barriers to quitting smoking cigarettes, according to state data.\n\nBy increasing access to services for mental health and substance use disorders, both before and after birth, Moore and Baldwin hope to lessen these disparities.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that seeking behavioral health or substance abuse disorder treatment \u2026 is not going to be associated with large out-of-pocket costs, because people will simply not pursue the treatment if they can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Baldwin said.\n\nWomen and children are 'canaries in the coal mine' of community health, says U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore\n\nWhen mothers thrive, their babies thrive. This has a compounding impact on the community, Moore said.\n\nThe mental health concerns a pregnant person faces can impact their baby\u2019s development, and even their behavioral health later in life, studies show. Once an infant is born, their health continues to be intertwined with that of their caregivers, infant mental health experts often say.\n\nBy removing barriers to accessing perinatal mental health care, Moore and Baldwin hope the bill will ultimately mitigate struggles for entire families. And when families succeed, Moore said, communities flourish.\n\n\u201cI think women and children are the canaries in a coal mine,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the women and children are not doing well, the community cannot be doing well at all.\u201d\n\nWhat's next for the Mental Health and MAMA Act?\n\nMoore said this bill builds on the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. Signed into law in 2008, this watershed legislation requires select insurance companies to provide mental health and substance use disorder benefits just as it does medical and surgical benefits.\n\nBut, as Moore and Baldwin said, more needs to be done to level the playing field between mental health and traditional health coverage \u2013 especially when it comes to perinatal patients.\n\nThe Mental Health and MAMA Act is one of many steps to do so. In the same vein, there\u2019s the Black Maternal Mental Health Momnibus Act of 2023 that aims to bolster maternal health outcomes. The package, championed by both Baldwin and Moore, contains 13 bills, including a measure they have introduced as a standalone bill, the Perinatal Workforce Act. None has yet to be signed into law, although some of the individual bills within that package have advanced at the committee level.\n\n\u201cWhat we learned is that your body doesn\u2019t have a chance if your mind is not working well,\u201d Moore said.\n\nBaldwin and Moore are working to garner support for their new bill. It has yet to be heard in committee.\n\nNatalie Eilbert covers mental health issues for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. She welcomes story tips and feedback.

      "title": "Biden-Harris Administration Expands Access to Mental Health and Substance Use Services with Addition of 10 New States to CCBHC Medicaid Demonstration Program",
      "news": "The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act gave HHS the authority to add 10 states to the CCBHC Medicaid Demonstration program every two years, starting with the 10 being announced today\n\nNote to editors and reporters: Video b-roll of a CCBHC and an explainer video \u201cWhat is a CCBHC?\u201d are available for download and use in reporting, courtesy of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in partnership with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), today welcomed 10 new states into the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) Medicaid Demonstration Program, after they successfully developed the necessary state-level infrastructure and worked with providers in their states to develop programs that meet CCBHC standards: Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island and Vermont. The CCBHC Medicaid Demonstration Program provides states with sustainable funding that helps them expand access to mental health and substance use services, supporting President Biden\u2019s Unity Agenda and the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s efforts to tackle the country\u2019s mental health and addiction crises. The expansion of the program directly supports the President\u2019s national strategy to transform our behavioral health system and builds on the Administration\u2019s previous work to build a better crisis continuum of care, including through the transition to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, add a new mobile crisis benefit to Medicaid and new crisis codes to the Medicare program.\n\n\u201cCertified Community Behavioral Health Clinics have significantly improved behavioral health treatment in our country, and today\u2019s announcement will dramatically expand and improve access to equitable, quality care for Americans with serious mental health and substance use treatment needs,\u201d said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. \u201cThanks to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, we are adding 10 new states to this groundbreaking demonstration across the country, ensuring our CCBHCs can serve more Americans who need our help.\u201d\n\nCCBHCs must ensure access to a comprehensive range of services, providing care coordination when needed and incorporating evidence-based practices and other supports based on a community needs assessment. This includes crisis services that are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. CCBHCs are also required to provide routine outpatient care within 10 business days.\n\n\u201cCertified Community Behavioral Health Clinics serve anyone who requests care for mental health or substance use conditions. With sustainable funding, CCBHCs in participating states will now be able to connect more people to the care they need,\u201d said HHS Deputy Secretary Andrea Palm. \u201cThis is another example of our commitment at HHS to transforming behavioral health and ensuring all Americans have access to behavioral health resources.\u201d\n\nThe Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), signed into law by President Joe Biden, gave HHS the authority to add 10 new states to the CCBHC Medicaid Demonstration program every two years, starting with the 10 being announced today. All of these states had previously received planning grants, including grants authorized by BSCA in 2022 to address the country\u2019s behavioral health crisis. The 10 states added today join 8 states that are already currently in the CCBHC Medicaid Demonstration program: Michigan, Missouri, Kentucky, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, and Oregon.\n\nIn March 2023, SAMHSA used BSCA funding to award 15 CCBHC state planning grants. The CCBHC planning phase assists states in certifying clinics as CCBHCs, establishing prospective payment systems for Medicaid reimbursable services, and preparing an application to participate in a four-year demonstration program. A notice of funding opportunity to award 15 additional states with planning grants is expected to be posted this summer for award early in Fiscal Year 2025, and 10 more states will have the opportunity to join the CCBHC Demonstration Program in Fiscal Year 2026. These expansions will build more CCBHCs across the country and, along with the SAMHSA CCBHC expansion grant program, will support increased adoption of this model.\n\n\u201cFor our communities to thrive, behavioral health, including mental health, needs to be prioritized,\u201d said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. \u201cThat requires an all-hands-on-deck approach, which is why it\u2019s so encouraging to see more states support person- and community-centered solutions like CCBHCs. Aligned with the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s commitment to mental health, CCBHCs equip communities with the tools they need to tackle many of society\u2019s most entrenched challenges \u2013 from substance use disorders and mental health crises to housing insecurity, public safety, and the more efficient use of our health care resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to welcome these 10 states in the CCBHC Medicaid Demonstration Program and look forward to adding more in the years to come. CCBHCs provide a model of care that supports wellness for the entire community and connects people to care. They guarantee access to services to individuals and families regardless of ability to pay,\u201d said Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA. \u201cEquity is a significant and overarching priority in all that we do, and expanding and improving the CCBHC model across America helps us to continue our path forward to make quality behavioral health care for everyone even more widely available.\u201d\n\nCCBHCs increase access to crisis and behavioral health care in the community. They have been shown to reduce homelessness and substance use among the people they serve and decrease use of emergency rooms and hospitalization. In September, HHS, through SAMHSA, awarded $127.7 million to expand CCBHCs across the U.S.\n\nThe CCBHC Demonstration Program provides reimbursement through Medicaid for the full cost of services that CCBHCs provide, at higher, more competitive rates than community mental health centers previously received for Medicaid eligible individuals. This sustainable funding also ensures CCBHCs can provide a more comprehensive range of services rather than fragmented services driven by separate billing codes.\n\nCCBHCs were created to transform mental health and substance use treatment across the country and provide sustainable funding for robust community outpatient mental health treatment. They are required to meet federal standards for the range of services that they provide. CCBHCs offer a no-wrong-door approach because they must serve anyone who requests care for mental health or substance use conditions, regardless of their ability to pay, place of residence, or age.\n\nIn 2017, the first CCBHCs were funded under Medicaid, with 67 clinics operating across eight states. Today, there are more than 500 CCBHCs across 46 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, most of which are supported through SAMHSA\u2019s CCBHC Expansion Grant program.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

      "title": "Medical startup Sword Health announces AI that patients can talk to",
      "news": "Pain management startup Sword Health on Tuesday announced a new artificial intelligence solution named Phoenix that patients can speak with for guidance through virtual physical therapy sessions.\n\nSword, founded in 2015, offers digital tools to help patients manage pain from home and avoid other treatments like opioids and surgery. The company has used AI within its products since its launch, but CEO Virg\u00edlio Bento told CNBC that Phoenix offers users a more human-like experience.\n\nPhoenix is designed to replicate the work of a care specialist. Bento said patients should feel like they have a physical therapist inside their homes. Patients can talk directly to Phoenix about how they are feeling, and the new \"specialist\" can respond, offer feedback and adjust the difficulty and duration of the session in real time.\n\nSword patients join sessions using a tablet from the company that can track their movement. Bento said Phoenix monitors their progress, and after each session, it summarizes their performance data and sends it to one of Sword's human clinicians for review.\n\nBento said Sword's AI is currently able to analyze movement and provide simple feedback, but Phoenix is more conversational. Phoenix's ability to analyze patients' data and generate recommendations also helps the company's clinicians operate more efficiently, Bento added.\n\nPhoenix will propose changes for the patient's next session, as well as a follow-up message about the session they completed. Bento said a human clinician decides whether to accept, reject or edit those recommendations. Sword's clinicians have authority over what exercises are appropriate for a patient, so Phoenix does not make any decisions independently.\n\n\"This is health care, so you will always need that final approval,\" Bento said in an interview. \"We have strong guardrails in terms of how we do things.\"\n\nPatients can sign up for Sword if it is supported by their employer or their health plan. Sword has already carried out more than 3 million AI-powered sessions with patients, according to a release Tuesday. Bento said the company has been focused on business customers but would like to make its solutions available to everyone.\n\nSword also said Tuesday it raised $100 million in a secondary sale to provide liquidity to current and former employees and early investors. Bento said the company is forecasting that it will be profitable this year, but it raised an additional $30 million in a primary sale to update its valuation.\n\nThe company has raised a total of $340 million and is valued at $3 billion, according to the release. It was valued at $2 billion in late 2021.\n\nSword said a mix of new and existing investors participated in the round, some of whom did not want to be named. Venture firms like Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund and General Catalyst have previously invested in the company.\n\nSword has been testing Phoenix with some patients using its \"Thrive\" digital physical therapy product. Bento said the company will continue rolling it out to more patients within Thrive and across its other offerings, including its pelvic health solution called \"Bloom,\" over the coming months.",

      "news": "When Elon Musk launched his artificial intelligence company xAI last July, it came with the usual grandiose mission that has come to define companies in the sector. The company would focus on AI solutions that are \u201ctruthful, competent and maximally beneficial for all humanity.\u201d\n\nWhether xAI ever fulfills that mission remains to be seen, but the company already is showing that it can raise capital to compete with some heavy hitters in the AI field like Microsoft and Google. xAI recently launched a $6 billion Series B funding round that will be used to fund product research and development across many fields.\n\nAnd at least one health care tech analyst believes the work that xAI is doing has significant potential to disrupt health care. The most obvious entry point for xAI in health care will be similar to what other tech giants are doing, notes Forbes contributor Sai Balasubramanian, M.D., J.D.: Increase task automation, improve clinical workflows and optimize clinician productivity.\n\nxAI began laying the foundation for its systems with the launch in November of its Grok-1 AI model that was designed to answer nearly any question. Since then, the company has released the updated Grok-1.5 model and Grok-1.5V with image understanding.\n\nThese and other tools create training foundation models that could fit into the daily health care workflow, Balasubramanian explains in a recent report.\n\nMusk, who also owns Tesla and SpaceX, could bring together his parallel interests with his company Neuralink, which has demonstrated success with its brain computer-interface technology. Neuralink is now focused on giving quadriplegics the ability to control their computers and mobile devices with their thoughts.\n\nNeuralink recently announced the first human implantation of the technology, which the company states is a significant milestone to potentially restore autonomy to millions of people with unmet medical needs. Although xAI and Neuralink are not yet related in an obvious manner, there is significant potential to cross-pollinate between the platforms, Balasubramanian says.",

      "news": "The Bloomberg American Health Initiative at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health announces its eighth cohort of Bloomberg Fellows, comprised of 60 individuals from 47 collaborating organizations and 19 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. Each fellow represents an organization working on one of the five critical health challenges facing the nation that the Bloomberg American Health Initiative focuses on addressing: Addiction and overdose, adolescent health, environmental challenges, the food system, and violence.\n\n\n\nFifty individuals were awarded full Master of Public Health scholarships and 10 received full scholarships to pursue Doctor of Public Health degrees.\n\nThe Bloomberg American Health Initiative was established in 2016 with a $300 million gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies in honor of the centennial of the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Through education, research, and practice, the Initiative works to improve health and life expectancy in the United States in ways that advance equity, use evidence, and change policy.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome this new cohort of fellows who will enrich the Initiative and our School community with their experience and insight,\u201d says Bloomberg School Dean Ellen J. MacKenzie, PhD, ScM. \u201cThey come to us from frontline organizations across America, and they are ready to be empowered with the tools of public health to make an even greater impact on their communities.\"\n\nTo date, the Bloomberg American Health Initiative has supported 389 Bloomberg Fellows representing 305 collaborating organizations from 43 states, Washington, D.C., and two territories that include law enforcement agencies, libraries, community-based organizations, and local health departments. The Initiative has also supported more than 300 grants to Bloomberg School faculty, students, and outside organizations.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has still not recovered from the tragic decline in life expectancy that began even before the pandemic, making the need for strong health leadership greater than ever,\u201d said Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies, and WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries. \u201cWe are glad to support these fellows as they work across disciplines to make their communities healthier and stronger.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Bloomberg Fellowship program provides full scholarships for full- or part-time study through the Bloomberg American Health Initiative. The fellows\u2019 current organization, or where they\u2019re currently employed, supports them in this work, collaborates with the Initiative, and plays a key role in the program.\n\nExamples of collaborating organizations represented in the 2024 cohort include:\n\nThe Center for Justice Innovation in New York collaborates with communities and justice systems to reduce involvement in the criminal legal system by strengthening the social and economic structures of marginalized, under-resourced, and over-policed communities.\n\nThe Capital Area Food Bank in Washington, D.C., works to address hunger by providing meals to other nonprofit organizations and addressing hunger\u2019s root causes with education, health care, and job training.\n\nLost&Found in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is a nonprofit committed to suicide prevention and mental health. The organization fosters peer support, advances research, raises awareness, and provides crucial support for those affected by suicide.\n\nUpon completion of their degrees, fellows work for at least one additional year with their organization to apply the skills learned during the fellowship. Information about program requirements is available online. The next application cycle opens on August 1, 2024, and the deadline is December 1, 2024.\n\n\u201cThe Bloomberg Fellowship represents people from every corner of the country, territories, and tribal nations that are committed to advancing health and equity in their communities,\u201d says Michelle Spencer, MS, deputy director of the Bloomberg American Health Initiative and Practice Professor in the Bloomberg School\u2019s Department of Health Policy and Management. \u201cI am thrilled that this new class will continue to bring public health tools and solutions across all of our nation\u2019s

      "title": "Hays County Health Department to host annual Summer Health Fair",
      "news": "SAN MARCOS, TX \u2013 The Hays County Health Department (HCHD) invites residents to the second annual Summer Health Fair from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, May 11 at its location on 101 Thermon Drive. The fair will feature free health services, including free vaccinations for eligible individuals under the Texas Vaccines for Children (TVFC) and Adult Safety Net (ASN) programs, vision screenings, STI/HIV screenings and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe main goal of this fair is to get as many children vaccinated as we can,\u201d said Tammy Crumley, Health Department director. \u201cThis effort will reduce pressure on other healthcare providers during the summer when families prepare for back-to-school vaccinations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTVFC is a state-managed program providing vaccines at no cost to eligible children who might not otherwise have access to the necessary immunizations. ASN extends this service to eligible adults, ensuring they receive essential vaccines to protect against preventable diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be eligible for the TVFC program, individuals must be 18 years of age or younger and meet at least one of the following criteria: be enrolled in Medicaid; be uninsured; be American Indian or Alaska Native; or have health insurance that does not cover vaccines. For the ASN program, individuals must be 19 years or older and be either uninsured or underinsured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our commitment to community health drives initiatives like this,\u201d said Matthew Gonzales, Health Department manager. \u201cBy providing free vaccines, we hope to eliminate barriers and make it easier for families to prioritize their children's well-being.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe health department will also be unveiling its new Mobile Vaccination Unit (MVU) at the fair with a ribbon cutting. The van was co-funded by a $100,000 grant from the St. David\u2019s Foundation and the remaining cost was covered by Hays County Commissioners Debbie Ingalsbe, Precinct 1, and Dr. Michelle Cohen, Precinct 2, through the American Relief Plan Act (ARPA) in response to community needs and a desire to improve public health. The MVU will allow the department to better serve residents by providing vaccines all over Hays County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Mobile Vaccination Unit will allow us to extend our services throughout the county and reach individuals who may face challenges traveling to San Marcos for vaccinations,\u201d said Crumley. \u201cWe are excited to share this huge milestone with the community during the Summer Health Fair.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the clinic goes on inside, a community resource fair will be happening outside. Dozens of local organizations and nonprofits will be present to share their valuable resources. Children will also be able to play games and win prizes during this part of the fair.\n\n\"We want to create a space where health and happiness go hand in hand,\u201d said Gonzales. \u201cBy creating a welcoming atmosphere outside, we are making sure kids grow up with positive memories of staying healthy.\"\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Summer Health Fair is open to the public, with no cost for admission or services provided. For more information about the Summer Health Fair and upcoming events, please visit the HCHD\u2019s Facebook page and Hays County Health Department webpage or contact Austin Baier at Austin.Baier@co.hays.tx.us or 512-393-5572.\n\n\n\n\n\n###",

David McSwain, MD, MPH, System Chief Medical Informatics Officer, UNC Health, and Professor of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine\n\nNicoleta Economou-Zavlanos, PhD, Director of Evaluation & Governance, Duke Health AI\n\nDavid Rhew, MD, Global Chief Medical Officer and Vice President of Healthcare, Microsoft.\n\nRhew said that AI tools that already exist could solve a huge problem in health care: the unsustainable rise in cost. \u201cNow is the chance to think about how to apply AI to reduce administrative burden and streamline care,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need infrastructure and mechanisms to do that, and we need to put in place guardrails so we\u2019re not having unintended consequences.\u201d By summarizing and compiling clinical visits, for example, AI tools can free up providers and improve access to care.\n\nFrom left: Micky Tripathi, PhD; Michael Pencina, PhD; Mary E. Klotman, MD; Andrea Palm; S. David McSwain, MD, MPH; David Rhew, MD; Nicoleta Economou-Zavlanos, PhD.\n\nEconomou-Zavlanos pointed out that mitigating discrimination and bias when using AI tools requires health systems to have a good grasp of the clinical AI algorithms that are in use and who is responsible for evaluating them. Duke\u2019s Algorithm-Based Clinical Decision Support (ABCDS) Oversight framework does that with a registration process, she said.\n\nPanelists also pointed out that while large health systems such as Duke and UNC have already begun efforts to evaluate AI tools, smaller health systems don\u2019t have the same resources and will need help. \u201cThat\u2019s where assurance labs and third-party approaches can be helpful, to offload that burden from those smaller health systems and provide some consistency across multiple health systems,\u201d said McSwain.\n\nTripathi agreed that evaluating AI tools will require public-private partnership. \u201cWe need to find a way to do this together and make it so that everyone can take advantage of it,\u201d he said, pointing out the importance of partnerships such as the Coalition for Health AI, of which Duke Health is a founding partner.\n\nEconomou-Zavlanos and McSwain both touched on the need to demystify AI for patients and to listen to their feedback and concerns.\n\n\u201cPeople with lower levels of health literacy and less trust in health care may opt out, leading to vastly different care for different populations,\u201d McSwain said. \u201cWe need to pair opt outs with digital health literacy tools. We have to make sure the information we provide patients is understandable and actionable and accounts for their level of health literacy. If we don\u2019t do that, we will exacerbate the digital divide.\u201d\n\nWhile the federal government has issued broad guidelines about AI in health care, such as a final rule passed in April 2024, under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, government and health systems will need to work together to implement such guidelines, Palm said. \u201cWe as an enterprise have more work to do certainly to put meat on the bones,\u201d she said.\n\nMary Klotman, MD, executive vice President for health affairs at Duke University and dean of the School of Medicine, opened and closed the event. She said she was reassured to see experts from government, academia, and industry focused on both the opportunities and risks of AI. \u201cAt the end of the day it is all about the people we serve, and that came across in all of your comments,\u201d she said.",

      "title": "Health officials keep eye on \u2018FLiRT\u2019 COVID variants that could lead to fall surge",
      "news": "With Maryland nearing 1.5 million reported cases of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, experts are monitoring new variants of the virus that could create a surge in cases in the coming months.\n\nDespite its cutesy nickname, health officials say the so-called \u201cFLiRT\u201d variants of COVID-19 seem to be more successful at evading immunity despite previous infections or vaccinations.\n\n\u201cWhile \u2018FLiRT\u2019 is an interesting name, it\u2019s actually based in science. Because, scientists have single letter initials for certain mutations that occur. And these FLiRT variants, they have two mutations, \u2018F\u2019 to an \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 to a \u2018T.\u2019 And so, someone just threw a little \u2018i\u2019 in between, and you get \u2018FLiRT,'\u201d said Andrew Pekosz, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nThe FLiRT strains are a result of convergent evolution, Pekosz said.\n\n\u201cA bunch of viruses in different places that are all developing the same mutations,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in essence \u2026 they all have the same mutations that are probably driving the increase in cases that we are seeing right now and evading preexisting immunity.\n\n\u201cBut because they\u2019re all genetically different, we don\u2019t have a way of lumping them all together,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside of some of these nicknames.\u201d\n\nThe current set of FLiRT strains do not appear to be a cause for additional caution or increased public safety policies.\n\nMaryland COVID-19 data Maryland Matters has been tracking COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations and demographic information since the start of the pandemic. You can check out all the data here.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any major changes in disease symptoms or severity that these variants are causing,\u201d Pekosz said.\n\nThe Maryland Department of Health plans to maintain its current messaging for COVID-19 precautions, and the FLiRT variants have not prompted any changes to prevention methods.\n\n\u201cVaccination is still recommended as the best protection against severe illness, hospitalization or death from COVID-19,\u201d said Chase Cook, the department\u2019s communications director, in a written statement.\n\nStandard procedures to reduce the spread of germs are also encouraged, such as washing hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and staying home when sick.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevetion estimates that as of May 11, only 28.3% of adult Marylanders had received an updated COVID-19 vaccine, which is defined as anyone receiving at \u201cleast one vaccination since September 14, 2023.\u201d\n\nThat is higher than the national average of 22.5% of adults with an updated COVID-19 shot, but lower than the rate of those who received a flu shot this year in Maryland. As of May 11, CDC estimates that 55.5% of Marylanders had received their flu shot.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really found a good way to communicate effectively to that population to get across the idea that COVID really is a concern,\u201d Pekosz said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as serious as it was at the beginning of the pandemic. But that\u2019s great \u2014 the reason that it\u2019s not as much as concern is because we have things like vaccines that reduce the severity and the case numbers.\u201d\n\nThe FLiRT strains may have complicated the process of developing an updated COVID-19 vaccine this year.\n\nAn advisory committee for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was scheduled to recommend on May 16 which strains of virus should be used to develop the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine. But the meeting was postponed to June 5, to \u201callow for additional time to obtain surveillance data and other information so the \u2026 committee will have more up-to-date information when discussing and making recommendations.\u201d\n\nMaryland Matters has been tracking weekly COVID updates from the Maryland Department of Health.\n\nAs of Wednesday, it said there had been at least 1,454,614 cases of COVID-19 reported since the start of the pandemic in 2020. Of those cases, 17,727 people died from the virus. The data shows that 86% of those deaths were of people aged 60 and older.\n\nPekosz says that vulnerable populations such as older people and those who are immunocompromised are still most at risk for severe cases of COVID-19, especially if they are not up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nThere tend to be fewer COVID-19 cases during the summer months, as fall and winter tend to be the seasons when the illness spikes.\n\nThe state health department said there had been 1,788 reported COVID-19 cases in Maryland since the start of May. That\u2019s down from 2,124 cases in April and 4,690 cases in March. There were 7,242 cases reported in February and 11,864 cases reported in January.\n\nKP.2 is one of the main strains that fall under the new \u201cFLiRT\u201d moniker, and is responsible for almost 30% of new COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to CDC estimates.\n\nPekosz explained that researchers differentiate specific strains of a disease by a \u201cclade,\u201d which is a string of numbers and letters that indicate the ancestry of a virus. The clades are useful to researchers but are often hard for the general public to follow, he said.\n\nPekosz recommends that people stay up-to-date with available vaccines to best protect themselves from COVID-19 if the FLiRT strain leads to a surge in the fall.\n\n\u201c[KP.2] is becoming the dominant virus. It will probably be the virus that is responsible for the fall surge of cases that we\u2019re going to see, that\u2019s almost guaranteed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the vaccine will be matched fairly well with it, come fall.\u201d\n\nHe said that despite the potential challenges the FLiRT strains may pose, antivirals can still combat symptoms, and COVID-19 tests will still detect the virus.\n\n\u201cWe have the tools to minimize the severe disease caused by COVID, we just have to be aware and utilize them when needed,\u201d he said.",

      "news": "DALLAS, June 4, 2024 \u2014 Significant barriers prevent or slow treatment for many patients with stroke, including long travel times to stroke center hospitals and the lack of availability of stroke specialists who can evaluate the patient and determine if they are a candidate for treatment.[1] Telehealth stroke care, also known as telestroke, can expand access to rural areas and other communities that face barriers to stroke care.\n\nA new American Heart Association certification for health care professionals is designed to help standardize training and increase skills and competencies for health care providers in telehealth stroke care delivery, as well as help improve stroke outcomes through the integration of telehealth. This is the third individual certification available through the American Heart Association\u2019s best-in-class, science-based certification portfolio.\n\nAn estimated 9.4 million Americans ages 20 and older have had a stroke, and stroke accounts for about 1 of every 19 deaths in the United States.[2] Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States. And the problem is only getting worse \u2014 projections show a 20.5% increase in stroke prevalence by 2030.[3]\n\nTelehealth stroke care uses interactive videoconferencing to provide specialists timely data to assist clinicians at the bedside in stroke-related decision-making for people seeking care at distant facilities that do not have a stroke neurologist available around the clock.\n\n\u201cTimely access to the latest therapies through expanded use of telehealth-enabled stroke care has been shown to greatly improve the quality of care and reduce disability from stroke, especially in areas with fewer neurologists and stroke experts,\u201d said Lee Schwamm, M.D., FAHA, volunteer member of the American Heart Association Center for Telehealth Expert Panel; senior vice president and chief digital health officer of Yale New Haven Health; and associate dean of digital strategy and transformation at Yale School of Medicine. \u201cThe American Heart Association\u2019s individual telehealth stroke certification is a way for health care professionals to ensure they are providing the highest quality of care and leveraging this evolving delivery modality to its fullest potential.\u201d\n\nThe new telehealth individual certification, supported by the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, is available through the Association\u2019s Professional Education Hub\u2122. The certification is an offering of the American Heart Association Center for Telehealth.\n\nThe certification is open to licensed medical professionals who complete prerequisite education. The certification process features:\n\nhigh-quality, evidence-based online telehealth stroke education that combines research, hands-on experiences and best practices;\n\nassessment delivery via live remote-proctoring, certification award and renewal via American Heart Association platforms; and\n\nindividual promotional opportunities by display of personalized certificate award and credentials, which are good for three years.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\n###\n\nAbout the American Heart Association\n\nThe American Heart Association is a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives.

      "news": "View Larger Image\n\nImage by Evan Lewis\n\nUAMS 12th Street Health & Wellness Center Receives Gold Star Rating\n\nBy Linda Satter\n\nThe rating is the highest awarded by the NAFC, whose mission is to ensure that the medically underserved have access to affordable, quality health care.\n\nLocated at 4010 W. 12th St. in Little Rock, the clinic has been providing services from students in all five UAMS colleges \u2014 Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Public Health \u2014 and the Graduate School, since its opening in early 2013.\n\nUnder the supervision of licensed health care professionals, the students provide health and wellness services, including disease and medication management, basic dental screenings, health screenings, education and immunizations for the community. The clinic focuses on preventative care and can write prescriptions for some chronic medical conditions.\n\nIt earned a Silver Star rating in 2020, the inaugural year of the NAFC\u2019s ratings system. It has received a Gold Star rating every year since then. The NAFC Standards Program awards gold, silver and bronze ratings.\n\n\u201cIt takes a huge amount of work to reach and maintain a Gold Star rating,\u201d said Elizabeth Gath, M.D., a professor in the UAMS College of Medicine Department of Internal Medicine who serves as the clinic\u2019s medical director.\n\nTo achieve a Gold Star rating, a free or charitable clinic must receive high scores in areas related to patient care, clinic and pharmacy responsibilities, administrative duties, credentialing and privileging systems, as well as risk management systems. The clinic had to submit information on its written policies and procedures to the NAFC, and then show that it successfully incorporated those standards.\n\n\u201cThese standards allow us to showcase the quality care provided to our patients to policymakers, partners, funders and stakeholders,\u201d the association said in a letter notifying UAMS of its rating. \u201cAdditionally, the standards assist the NAFC in developing benefits and resources that will help our members enhance the care you provide to patients.\u201d\n\nThere are about 1,400 free or charitable clinics across the United States that are registered with the NAFC. Gath noted that only 6% of NAFC-registered clinics are student led.\n\n\u201cThe 12th Street Health & Wellness Center is unique in this award,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are proud of our Student Board of Directors and Leadership Committee who work diligently to provide quality care to our patients. We also cooperate with our Community Advisory Board regularly to ensure that what we do is respectful of the community\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mission of the National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics is to ensure that the medically underserved have access to affordable health care,\u201d it says. \u201cThe NAFC and its members are dedicated to ensuring that patients receive quality health care.\u201d\n\nThe 12th Street Health & Wellness Center had more than 1,000 unique patient encounters in 2023, Gath said, which allowed patients to avoid unnecessary emergency visits and relieved anguish over health concerns.\n\nAccording to recent statistics, about 2 million patients receive care at free and charitable clinics and pharmacies throughout the United States. About 82% of the patients are uninsured and about 63% of them are employed. There were 682,000 new patients seen at the clinics in the last year. Gath said these statistics are \u201cconsistent with what we see at 12th Street. Most of our patients are workers in construction, landscaping, the food industry and hospitality who do not have access to medical insurance through their jobs.\u201d Another large group are those who \u201cfall through the cracks of Medicaid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 12th Street Health & Wellness Center is a value to our students who learn interprofessionalism and how to care for patients with guidance,\u201d Gath said. \u201cIt\u2019s a value to our faculty, who provide educational and administrative support. Mostly, it is a value to the community, caring for those who have no other access to health care. We believe that health care is a right, not just a privilege.\u201d\n\nIn short, she said, \u201cthe 12th Street Health & Wellness Center helps keep our community healthier and hopeful.\u201d\n\nUAMS is the state\u2019s only health sciences university, with colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Health Professions and Public Health; a graduate school; a hospital; a main campus in Little Rock; a Northwest Arkansas regional campus in Fayetteville; a statewide network of regional campuses; and eight institutes: the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute, Jackson T. Stephens Spine & Neurosciences Institute, Harvey & Bernice Jones Eye Institute, Psychiatric Research Institute, Donald W.

      "news": "June 4, 2024\n\nAt the end of July, the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health will bid farewell to Carolyn Halpern, PhD, who has served the state of North Carolina for more than 40 years as a researcher, professor, faculty fellow at the Frank Porter Graham Institute of Child Development and the Carolina Population Center, and, since 2015, chair of the Department of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) at the Gillings School. Halpern will retire at the end of July and will be handing over leadership of the department to a new chair as MCH students return to campus to train as future public health leaders.\n\nHalpern\u2019s research, mentorship and leadership in maternal and child health, specifically in adolescent and young adult sexual health, have made her a respected figure in the field. She has authored or co-authored 175 peer-reviewed publications and 17 book chapters on these topics. She has led and collaborated on multimillion-dollar projects funded by the National Institutes of Health and served as the primary mentor for 35 Master of Public Health, 23 doctoral graduates and 13 postdoctoral trainees. Halpern has received multiple university-wide and national awards for mentoring and academic leadership, including the John E. Larsh Jr. Student Mentorship Award from the Gillings School and the UNC-Chapel Hill Graduate School Faculty Award for Excellence in Doctoral Mentoring.\n\nHalpern shepherded the MCH department through many transitions and has been dedicated to enhancing the department\u2019s expertise and commitment to student success, as well as ground-breaking research and public service. During her tenure as chair, she has worked to increase the diversity of students, staff and faculty. Her legacy includes the hiring of new tenure-track and tenured faculty who are tackling important issues of maternal and child health equity.\n\nRecent MCH faculty hires include:\n\nAssociate Professor Larissa Jennings Mayo-Wilson, PhD, MHS \u2013 Dr. Jennings Mayo-Wilson\u2019s research focuses on improving sexual and reproductive health (SRH), including HIV prevention, in vulnerable adolescents and young adults in the United States and sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, she is interested in: (i) design and evaluation of economic-strengthening interventions to reduce inequities in HIV/SRH, including microenterprise, cash transfers, savings, and financial incentives; (ii) analysis of economic and structural causes of disparities in HIV/SRH, and (iii) use of mobile health technologies to improve implementation and evaluation of HIV/SRH interventions. Her research also examines socio-economic influences on maternal health care-seeking and uptake of assisted reproductive technologies. She has a joint faculty appointment in the Department of Health Behavior at the Gillings School\n\nAssistant Professor Kristin Z. Black, PhD, MPH \u2013 Dr. Black is committed to utilizing community-based participatory research, mixed methods, and racial equity approaches to understand and address inequities in reproductive health and chronic disease outcomes. Her research merges 3 key components. First, Dr. Black explores the connections between reproductive health, maternal health, and chronic diseases, and whether these outcomes differ by race/ethnicity or other social identities. Second, she focuses on understanding what individual- and systems-level factors may hinder or facilitate birthing people\u2019s journey through maternal healthcare services.

      "title": "Get your health care through Covered California? Beware of this tax peril",
      "news": "In summary Every year thousands of Californians are shocked to learn they owe the IRS for their subsidized health plan. Here\u2019s how to avoid it.\n\nEvery tax season hundreds of thousands of Californians are hit with an unexpected bill: They owe hundreds of dollars or more to the IRS because they accepted more money in subsidies for health insurance than they were allowed.\n\nThe chargeback can sting. Collectively, 415,000 California households owed the IRS close to $690 million in 2021 in charges related to the health care subsidies, according to agency data from the most recent year available. That is roughly $1,662 per person or family. Many people who end up owing money live in lower-income households.\n\nThis repayment rule is connected to the federal Affordable Care Act and the state-based health insurance plans it encouraged. Covered California, the state\u2019s insurance marketplace, offers generous premium subsidies to those who qualify based on their income, but people can unknowingly receive too much aid if they underestimate how much they\u2019ll earn the following year or if they lose a dependent and do not report that change.\n\nThe federal government collects any \u201cexcess\u201d aid when people file their taxes. The government calls this process \u201creconciliation.\u201d\n\nTen years after the rollout of the insurance marketplace, many Californians continue to be caught off guard come tax filing time. Often the charges come as a shock.\n\n\u201cThey feel like they\u2019re following the rules, they\u2019re getting their coverage. And, they just kind of feel like they\u2019re getting in trouble for doing everything right,\u201d said Audrey Casillas, assistant director of community economic development services at Koreatown Youth and Community Center. Her nonprofit helps local low-income residents prepare their taxes at no cost as part of a Los Angeles County tax assistance program.\n\nThe people who receive excess aid are not wealthy. About half of the households who owed the IRS for excess premium subsidies in tax year 2021 earned less than $50,000, according to data from the agency.\n\nAlex Hernandez, an insurance broker in Merced, said most people can avoid this clawback by reporting any changes in income and dependents to Covered California as soon as possible. This way the agency will adjust the amount of premium subsidies a person or family is receiving, and they\u2019ll avoid an unpleasant surprise come tax filing time.\n\nHernandez tells clients to report all taxable income to the agency\u2014 that includes any extras, such as a bonus or significant winnings from a lucky night at the casino.\n\n\u201cSome members who are doing the enrollment themselves think that they need to go by last year\u2019s income, and that\u2019s not always the case,\u201d Hernandez said. People should instead estimate income based on their current situation, he explained.\n\nDon\u2019t wait for open enrollment\n\nCovered California in an emailed response to questions from CalMatters said it sends a notice reminding enrollees to report any changes, such as income and household size, before they sign up for or renew coverage.\n\n\u201cConsumers are reminded throughout the notice to ensure their information is accurate, and states what the tax implications are if information is incorrect,\u201d Jagdip Dhillon, a Covered California spokesperson, said in an email.\n\nOf course, people shouldn\u2019t wait until open enrollment to declare changes. Enrollees can report changes at any point, either with the help of an enrollment counselor or by calling Covered California directly.\n\n\u201cPeople may need mid-year reminders, if you\u2019re only getting this (notice) once a year it can be kind of late,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, director of the program on the Affordable Care Act at KFF, a health policy organization that conducts polling and research. \u201cOpen enrollment is in November and tax season is April. It might be a good idea to think about it in July.\u201d\n\nThe reconciliation rule also works the other way around. People who overestimate their income and receive less subsidies than they\u2019re eligible for could get money back. And for those who make less than 400% of the federal poverty level, there are limits to how much they\u2019d have to repay the IRS if they were to owe.\n\nAt the time of learning they\u2019ll owe the IRS, some people question whether they should keep their health insurance, Casillas said. But people may also owe if they go without insurance. That\u2019s because California is one of five states that requires residents to have health insurance. Those who go without it may face penalties.\n\nMany save money with Covered California\n\nSome people who have encountered this issue in the past see it as a tradeoff, Casillas said. They pay very little for their health insurance every month, but pay hundreds or a couple thousand dollars when they file their taxes. For many people, what they end up owing the IRS is still less than what they\u2019d pay for a health plan at full price or what they\u2019d pay for a hospital visit, Casillas said.\n\n\u201cWe just tell them, \u2018Hey, you know what, these things can be unpredictable. You want to have some savings,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nCorrectly estimating next year\u2019s earnings can be especially difficult for people who freelance or job hop, causing their estimates to be less precise, experts say.\n\n\u201cA lot of people on the ACA marketplace do have incomes that can be very volatile. They might be piecing together part-time jobs or are self-employed or small business owners,\u201d Cox said.\n\nHernandez said he advises people enrolled in a Covered California plan to find an agent of their own and check in with them every so often. Because agents get commissions from insurance companies, this service is often free to the public. This is the best way to be informed and avoid unexpected charges, he said.\n\nSupported by the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF), which works to ensure that people have access to the care they need, when they need it, at a price they can afford.

      "title": "Why California families are getting a tax surprise for health care",
      "news": "For families seeking affordable health insurance, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace, Covered California, can provide major relief. But if they\u2019re not careful, they can get hit by an unexpected federal tax bill.\n\nAs CalMatters health reporter Ana B. Ibarra explains, enrollees can sometimes unknowingly receive too much aid if they underestimate their income the following year, or if they fail to report that they lost a dependent. This \u201cexcess\u201d aid is connected to the federal Affordable Care Act, and is collected by the federal government when people file their taxes.\n\nIn 2021, about 415,000 California households owed the Internal Revenue Service close to $690 million in charges related to the Covered California subsidies, or an average of $1,662 per person or family. About half of these households in 2021 earned less than $50,000.\n\nSo how do you avoid paying this tax bill? First, declare changes in income and dependents to Covered California or an enrollment counselor as soon as possible. Report all taxable income, including any extras, such as salary bonuses. And to remain really up-to-date, find an insurance agent and check in with them every so often. They often provide services for free, since agents get commissions from insurance companies.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about skipping out on health insurance altogether than owe the IRS, keep in mind that California requires residents to have coverage, and you could still end up paying a penalty. And remember: The repayment process works the other way around too. If you overestimate your income and receive less subsidies than you\u2019re eligible for, you could get money back.\n\nFor more on repaying health care subsidies, read Ana\u2019s story.\n\nSpeaking of health care challenges in California: A significant number of homeless individuals on the street have mental health issues. There\u2019s a new tactic becoming more common \u2014 shots to prevent psychotic episodes, writes CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall.\n\nThese antipsychotics, which can ease symptoms for a month or longer, are administered by street medicine teams wherever patients reside. Unlike oral pills, the medication can\u2019t be lost or stolen off an unhoused resident, nor does it require a pharmacy refill.\n\nTreatment is voluntary and doctors say the goal of administering these shots is to get someone living in an encampment to begin thinking clearly, so they can engage with social workers, sign up for benefits and get on housing waitlists.\n\nThere are some side effects, such as dizziness and decreased mobility, which can be severely dire for someone living on the street. For doctors, their main challenge is following up with patients who can be difficult to track. Some wary patients also don\u2019t want the shots.\n\nBut for others, such as Ricardo Fonseca Jr., the medication can be a godsend. Before becoming homeless, he worked as a welder. After a sudden mental breakdown, he started hearing voices. Two months ago, Fonseca started taking a monthly shot of an antipsychotic drug.\n\nFonseca: \u201cEverything\u2019s changed \u2026 I can finally hear the birds and the crickets. I couldn\u2019t hear them before.\u201d\n\nRead more about the antipsychotic treatment in Marisa\u2019s story.",

      "news": "Want to learn more about this at Kettering Health?\n\nDid you know that women ages 20 to 39 are twice as likely to have a stroke than men the same age? They also tend to be more severe in women.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Dr. Akil Patel, a neurosurgeon, says, \u201cmore women die of stroke.\u201d\n\nWomen have unique risk factors that make them more at risk for stroke. And because women\u2019s stroke symptoms tend to be milder, it often takes three times longer than men for them to receive care.\n\nDr. Patel explains stroke risk factors and symptoms for women.\n\nRisk factors\n\nOne of the most significant stroke risk factors for women is pregnancy.\n\nFluctuating hormones and fluids during pregnancy increase the chances of blood thickening and clotting, which can cause a stroke. The risk increases if a woman develops preeclampsia.\n\nA woman\u2019s risk continues in the days after delivery.\n\n\u201cThe body is trying to figure out its new normal,\u201d Dr. Patel says, \u201cso patients can have persistent hypertension during that time. That could put a big strain on their brain.\u201d\n\nAnother unique risk factor is taking oral contraceptive (birth control) pills. While rare, hormonal birth control pills can cause blood to thicken and clot. Dr. Patel encourages women on the pill to stay hydrated and avoid smoking to reduce their risk for stroke.\n\nHormone replacement therapy, often taken post-menopause, can also increase a woman\u2019s risk for blood clotting and stroke.\n\nBesides hormonal risk factors, Dr. Patel shares that women who experience migraines with aura or have AFib also have a higher stroke risk than men with the same conditions.\n\nStroke symptoms in women\n\nThe most common symptoms of stroke, regardless of gender, are\n\nSlurred speech\n\nFacial drooping\n\nWeakness on one side of the body\n\n\u201cIn women,\u201d Dr. Patel says, \u201csometimes it\u2019s not that drastic.\u201d\n\nSymptoms more commonly seen in women include\n\nGeneralized weakness/fatigue\n\nDisorientation\n\nMental status change\n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, call 911 or go to your nearest emergency department.\n\nDon\u2019t wait\n\nThe sooner you receive care, the more treatment options are available.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much to offer now,\u201d Dr. Patel says. \u201cBut we can\u2019t do it if it goes hours and hours to where the brain has already sustained irreversible damage.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding your risk and recognizing symptoms increases your chances of catching a stroke early and reversing the damage done to your brain.",

      "news": "A Pennsylvania man who had been serving life for second-degree murder is dead, about two weeks after being granted a medical transfer from prison to a facility that could better treat his condition, including quadriplegia\n\nPITTSBURGH -- A Pennsylvania man who had been serving life for second-degree murder died over the weekend, 12 days after being granted a medical transfer from prison to a facility that could better treat his condition, including quadriplegia.\n\nEzra Bozeman, 68, died on Saturday at the UPMC Altoona medical center, Ryan Tarkowski, communications director for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, confirmed on Tuesday.\n\nHe had been jailed for 49 years before an Allegheny County judge granted his request for compassionate release last month.\n\nBozeman had been on life support. He had a back injury that had been misdiagnosed for several years, according to his lawyer, Dolly Prabhu, and he required extensive medical care after he became paralyzed from the chest down after surgery.\n\nAn aide to Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala, whose office had opposed the release, said they had no comment on Bozeman's death.\n\nPrabhu, with the Abolitionist Law Center, described Bozeman as \u201cthe sweetest, sweetest person.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was always, always so optimistic,\u201d Prabhu said Tuesday. \u201cAnd he was confident that it wasn\u2019t a matter of if he gets out, it was when he gets out.\u201d\n\nBozeman had been convicted in 1975 in the shooting death of Morris Weitz, a dry-cleaning business co-owner, during an attempted robbery. He had maintained he was innocent.\n\nPennsylvania's compassionate release law covers incarcerated people who are seriously ill and expected to die within a year. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that about 50 people have been granted compassionate release over the past 15 years.\n\nPrabhu said it is common for prisoners seeking compassionate release to be close to death, which she said is a consequence of the terms of Pennsylvania's law on compassionate release. She said there are \u201chundreds of Ezra Bozemans\u201d in the state's prisons, and prisons are not equipped to care for very sick, elderly people.\n\n\u201cWe have such harsh sentencing laws, and so we have so many elderly people right now incarcerated,\u201d Prabhu said. \u201cAnd compassionate release is one of the few avenues they have in getting out and getting the care that they need.\"",

      "news": "A recent study conducted during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic sheds light on the factors influencing nurses\u2019 decisions to continue or leave their jobs.\n\nThe research, led by experts at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing and published in the Online Journal of Issues in Nursing, emphasizes the critical role of coworker and employer support in determining nurses\u2019 job satisfaction and retention.\n\nThe study, which surveyed 629 nurses across 36 states in the U.S., highlighted the impact of workplace dynamics and mental health on nurses\u2019 intentions to stay in their roles. The findings underscored the importance of organizational support and mental well-being in enhancing nurses\u2019 job satisfaction and reducing turnover rates.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings underscored the direct link between workplace support and nurses\u2019 job satisfaction amid the challenges of heightened stress and burnout among healthcare workers during the pandemic. It revealed that nurses who felt supported by their colleagues and organization were more likely to desire to remain in their positions than those who lacked adequate support. This highlights the need for healthcare leaders to prioritize creating supportive work environments to retain nursing professionals.\n\nOn the other hand, symptoms of depression were closely linked to nurses considering leaving their jobs within the following year. The researchers emphasized the need for organizations to prioritize mental health resources, such as employee assistance programs and therapy services, to support nurses facing burnout and other mental health challenges.\n\nWith the study\u2019s compelling findings on the crucial role of workplace support and mental health initiatives, healthcare institutions have a clear path to improving nurses\u2019 well-being, job satisfaction, and retention rates. The study\u2019s authors strongly advocate for employers to invest in creating healthy work environments that foster staff support and implement policies to protect nurses from depression and burnout and cultivate a supportive work culture for their nursing staff.\n\nThe study, \u201cFactors Associated with Working During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Intent to Stay at Current Nursing Position,\u201d is available to American Nurses Association members and will be publicly available on September 30, 2024.

Four months\u2019 worth, uncashed.\n\n\u201cEvery year, it\u2019s a little worse,\u201d Jones said of the financial pressures on his business.\n\nRural pharmacies, independent or chain, can be a touchstone for their communities. The staff knows everyone\u2019s names and drugs, answers questions about residents\u2019 mail-order prescriptions or can spot the signs of serious illness.\n\nBut rural pharmacies\u2019 business models face unrelenting pressures to the point that sometimes they have to close. Several largely rural states have some of the lowest number of pharmacies per ZIP code, according to an AP analysis of data from 49 states and the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs.\n\nThe closest pharmacy to Basin Pharmacy is eight miles away in Greybull, and Jones and two other pharmacists opened it after the department store chain that ran its predecessor went bankrupt.\n\nEFFECTS OF A CLOSURE\n\nWhen a pharmacy does close in a rural area, communities feel the absence.\n\nIn Herscher, Illinois, news came out of nowhere that the CVS would shut down in early March.\n\nMayor Shannon Sweeney met with CVS representatives and asked them to delay the closure for his village of 1,500 that\u2019s 80 miles south of Chicago, but he said the company told him the front of the store was not making enough money.\n\nPharmacy access is an important consideration, CVS spokesman Matt Blanchette told The Associated Press, but the company also weighs local market dynamics, population shifts and the number of stores in the area selling similar products. He confirmed the meeting with Sweeney, but did not directly answer a question about what financial issues led to the store closure.\n\nTammy McLearen came to the CVS twice a month to pick up medications for her blood pressure and cholesterol on her way to and from work near Kankakee.\n\nJoseph Yearicks talks to Marla Winters after picking up a prescription at Basin Pharmacy in Basin, Wyo.

(AP Photo/Mike Clark)\n\nShe moved her prescriptions to the CVS near work because she doesn\u2019t want to get them through the mail; her village isn\u2019t a top priority for snow removal in the winter \u2014 and her late husband\u2019s heart medications would often get lost in the mail.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing convenience, a staple,\u201d she said of the pharmacy, which was part of a small statewide chain before CVS bought it in 2017. \u201cI hope another pharmacy goes in here.\u201d\n\nSweeney said that\u2019s his goal \u2014 preferably an independent one. But in the months since the closure, two promising leads have dried up, leaving the them \u201cdead in the water,\u201d he said.\n\nFINANCIAL PRESSURES\n\nFour of Wyoming\u2019s independent pharmacies closed last year, said Melinda Carroll, legislative director of the state\u2019s pharmacy association. Two more, one independent and one chain, closed so far this year.\n\nJones plans to hold out in Basin. He owns two other businesses there \u2014 a caf\u00e9 next to the pharmacy and a grocery store, for which he cashed in some of his retirement accounts to keep it from closing.\n\nCraig Jones, center, works with the other pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to fill prescriptions at Basin Pharmacy in Basin, Wyo.

(AP Photo/Mike Clark)\n\nBut some 25% of the prescriptions he fills today are reimbursed for less than what he bought the medications for. Jones said he lost $30,000 between the beginning of the year and mid-May.\n\nHence, the uncashed checks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working for free a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mind. I love to serve the community. But I kind of resent having to do that because of large corporations, huge pharmacy benefit managers, that are making millions of dollars a year.\u201d\n\nPharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, help employers and insurers decide which drugs are covered for millions of Americans.\n\nAnd the the lack of transparency around fees and low reimbursements from is one of the biggest financial pressures for rural pharmacies, said Delesha Carpenter of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who leads a research alliance of more than 140 rural pharmacies and seven universities.\n\nThe Basin Pharmacy is seen in Basin, Wyo. (AP Photo/Mike Clark)\n\nBut Greg Lopes, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association that represents PBMs, disputed PBMs\u2019 role in closures and noted that some companies work with rural pharmacies to get higher reimbursements for drugs.\n\nJones came back to the Basin area after pharmacy school. His daughter Camilla would come into the pharmacy with him on Sundays and he\u2019d quiz her on different medications.\n\nShe\u2019s now the president-elect of the state pharmacy association and helps run the Basin pharmacy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely tried to do everything we can to run lean to find other options to try and make money to keep our doors open so we can continue to serve patients,\u201d Camilla Hancock said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re working so hard and you\u2019re trying your darndest to accomplish these things, and you just kind of get kicked in the gut over and over, it\u2019s really disheartening.\u201d\n\nCamilla Hancock takes a blood pressure reading from a patient for a medical study at Basin Pharmacy.

      "title": "Rabid raccoon discovered in town of Pamelia, Public Health says",
      "news": "WATERTOWN, New York (WWNY) - A rabid raccoon was found in the town of Pamelia.\n\nThe Jefferson County Public Health Service said Tuesday the raccoon was submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where it tested positive.\n\nPublic Health says no humans or pets were exposed.\n\nRabies is a fatal disease that attacks the brain and spinal cord. It can take several weeks to several months for rabies symptoms to appear. Early treatment after exposure can prevent rabies in humans and in pets who are up to date on their vaccinations.\n\nAny mammal can get rabies, but it is most often seen in bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes.\n\nAnimals do not have to be aggressive or behave erratically to have rabies. Changes in an animal\u2019s behavior can be early signs of the disease.\n\nPublic Health advises taking the following steps:\n\n1. Teach children to stay away from unfamiliar animals, either wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. Remind them to tell you if they have any unusual contact with an animal.\n\n2. Do not leave pet food outside as it attracts wildlife to your home.\n\n3. Wash any wound from an animal encounter thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical attention immediately.\n\n4. Be a responsible pet owner by keeping your pet\u2019s vaccinations current. Getting your pet vaccinated by your vet or at a clinic (Petco, Tractor Supply and Pet Supplies Plus offer rabies vaccination clinics) can help stop the spread of rabies from wild animals to humans. JCPHS is hosting a rabies vaccination clinic at Jefferson County Dog Control from 5 to 7 p.m. on Thursday, June 20. Visit www.jcphs.org for more information.\n\n5. Monitor your pets when they are outside. If a pet is involved in an altercation with a wild animal, do not get in between them. Do not touch your pet without gloves as rabies spreads through saliva. Cover your pet with a towel and contact your veterinarian, as your pet may need a booster shot.\n\nCopyright 2024 WWNY. All rights reserved.",

      "title": "This is the biggest health threat to women in their 60s",
      "news": "A surprising number of women don\u2019t realize it, but their biggest health risk in their 60s is heart disease. It\u2019s the leading cause of death in women in the United States, so many key recommendations focus on maintaining cardiovascular health.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to know and recognize the symptoms of a heart attack because they\u2019re often different in women than in men. Though women may experience the typical chest pain associated with a heart attack, they\u2019re more likely than men to experience a combination of symptoms, says Stacey Rosen, a cardiologist at Northwell Health in New York City.\n\n\u201cWomen will often get shortness of breath, accompanying chest pain, back pain, a fatigue that\u2019s easy to write off,\u201d Rosen says. \u201cYou have that Spidey sense. If something's not right, get it checked out because this becomes dangerous time for women.\u201d\n\nAt age 65, women in the U.S. qualify for Medicare\u2014the government-funded federal healthcare insurance program that replaces individuals\u2019 private insurance\u2014and everyone in this age group should take advantage of the initial \u201cWelcome to Medicare\u201d wellness exam covered in your first year of the program. It gives your provider and you an opportunity to get a thorough snapshot of your current health and biggest risks as well as review the preventive health services and screenings you should be getting.\n\nIn fact, Medicare covers a wellness exam every year. You can likely expect basic screenings for hearing loss and for cognitive health at these exams, says Jorge Ruiz, a geriatrician at Memorial Healthcare System in Hollywood, Florida, and your provider will review what else might be recommended for you.\n\nFirst in our six-part series\n\nMost people know the basics of living healthy: eat and sleep well, exercise, schedule an annual check up, and get the recommended vaccinations. But keeping up with self-care plus getting screenings for cancer and other diseases can be daunting. \u201cHealth\u201d also varies for women at different stages of their lives. So, we\u2019re bringing you a women\u2019s health series that covers the most important health issues for women in each decade of their lives. Here is the first of those, reviewing where women in their 60s should be putting their focus to live their best, healthiest life.\n\nBut keep in mind, Ruiz adds, that \u201cthese are guidelines, and they shouldn\u2019t be too rigid, especially as you get older.\u201d Your provider should be helping you consider the risks and benefits of any screenings for your specific health situation as you start heading toward your golden years.\n\nCardiovascular, metabolic, and brain health\n\nNearly half of all adults have high blood pressure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but only one in four adults with high blood pressure have it under control. Unmanaged hypertension substantially increases your risk for heart disease and stroke, so working with your provider to keep it below 130/80 is important for your cardiovascular health.\n\nAnother reason to look after your heart is for that other organ people start worrying about as they age \u2014 the brain. Risk of dementia begins to increase above age 65, so \u201cbeing proactive to reduce one\u2019s risk of dementia is obviously very important,\u201d Thomas Wisniewski, a neurologist at NYU Langone Health, says.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s good for your heart is good for your brain,\u201d especially because the brain is the most \u201coxygen-hungry\u201d organ in the body, he says. \u201cHaving a healthy vascular system is very important for brain health and resilience, so just being physically active is very protective,\u201d as well as keeping medical issues such as high cholesterol, high blood sugar and hypertension well managed.\n\nOther ways to reduce risk of cognitive decline include eating a Mediterranean diet, getting adequate sleep, staying mentally active, and getting screened for sleep apnea if you snore\u2014the risk increases with age. \u201cBe diverse with mental stimulation,\u201d Wisniewski says. \u201cReading, discussing what you read, being socially interactive, doing new things, taking up lessons, adult learning, crossword puzzles, Sudoku, jigsaw puzzles\u2014all of those things in aggregate are highly beneficial.\u201d",

      "news": "CHAMPAIGN, Ill. \u2014 The state of Illinois has emerged as a leader in passing legislation focused on the detection and treatment of perinatal mental health issues, yet more work is needed to improve outcomes for women and their children, researchers suggested in a recent review of Illinois\u2019 policies.\n\nAmong the six Illinois policies on these issues enacted since 2008 \u201cthere are exceptional examples that capture Illinois\u2019 efforts to address perinatal mental health,\u201d the team wrote.\n\nCurrently, Illinois is one of only five states \u2014 along with California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and West Virginia \u2014 to require or mandate screening for maternal mental health conditions, according to the study.\n\n\u201cIllinois has sought to address perinatal mental health at the population level using policy as a tool to expand awareness of and develop systems to identify those in need of care \u2014 and there are examples that can extend to other states in the nation.\u201d said Karen M. Tabb, a social work professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the senior and corresponding author of the paper. Her co-authors were U. of I. social work professor Sandra Kopels; Wan-Jung Hsieh, a professor of social work at National Taiwan University; and U. of I. alumnus Xavier Ramirez.\n\nIllinois had the second lowest rate \u2014 8.1% \u2014 of postpartum depressive symptoms among the 27 states that collected Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data in 2012, according to the study, published in Frontiers in Psychiatry.\n\nAn initiative of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, PRAMS collects data on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during and shortly after pregnancy.\n\nYet, even when depressive symptoms are detected, they often go untreated, as only 22% of the women who screen positive receive mental health treatment, the researchers wrote.\n\nSuicide is a leading cause of death for women up to one year post-delivery. Early detection and treatment could prevent women harming themselves, their children or others, the team wrote.\n\nIllinois was the first state to enact a law that allows untreated or undiagnosed postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis and anxiety disorders related to pregnancy or childbirth to be used as a defense in criminal cases and as a factor in withholding or minimizing women\u2019s sentences after conviction. For these conditions to be used as a mitigating factor, the disorder must have been undiagnosed when the criminal act occurred but been diagnosed since by a qualified health care professional.\n\nIllinois\u2019 second Perinatal Mental Health Disorders Prevention and Treatment Act, enacted in 2008 and amended in 2015 and 2018, strives to create a safety net by requiring several state agencies to develop educational materials for women and their families and conduct assessments for perinatal mental health conditions during prenatal and postnatal visits.\n\nUnder the law, health professionals that provide prenatal services as well as hospitals that provide labor and delivery services are required to inform women and their family members about the symptoms of perinatal mental health disorders. Likewise, clinicians are required to invite women to undergo screenings during prenatal and postnatal visits and at well-baby checkups.\n\nWhen these screenings indicate that patients may be experiencing mental health problems, based on clinicians\u2019 medical judgment, they are required to administer further assessments.\n\nIllinois\u2019 other notable policy effort in this area is the Maternal Mental Health Conditions Education, Early Diagnosis and Treatment Act, enacted in 2020 to raise awareness about the risk factors, signs, symptoms and treatment options. Under this law, the Illinois Department of Human Services is required to develop educational materials for health professionals and patients, and hospitals are required to use them in employee training.\n\nLikewise, a 2023 legislative directive requires the Illinois Department of Public Health to work with the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics to encourage physicians to conduct postpartum mental health screenings at well-baby visits.\n\nPrior studies of Illinois residents found significant disparities among racial minorities and low-income populations, with higher rates of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideations in these groups.\n\nIn April 2021, Illinois became the first state to expand Medicaid coverage from 60 days to the first year postpartum. Governor J.B. Pritzker hailed the expansion as part of his administration\u2019s efforts to \u201creduce health disparities in communities across the state and improve maternal health outcomes for women of color.\u201d\n\nIllinois legislators have been instrumental in advancing federal policies focused on maternal mental health, according to the study. U.S. Senator Dick Durbin and U.S. Representative Bobby Rush co-sponsored a bill \u2014 language from which was incorporated into the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2014 that increased funding for research and programs on perinatal depression and psychosis.\n\n\u201cThese legislative efforts are great strides forward in raising awareness of perinatal mental health problems and helping women who are experiencing them access treatment,\u201d Tabb said. \u201cHowever, far too many of these conditions are still going undetected and untreated. And that has long-term negative implications not only for women, but their infants, partners and other family members as well.\u201d",

The report outlines the unprecedented humanitarian crisis, characterized by soaring levels of civilian mortality and morbidity, forced displacements, destruction of essential infrastructure and targeting of the health-care system. It notes that mass displacements, severe overcrowding and scant access to water, sanitation and health care for displaced people significantly increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks. It outlines the work WHO has done to respond to the crisis, including coordination of the health response with partners, and high-risk missions to hospitals to assess conditions, deliver critical supplies, coordinate the deployment of emergency medical teams, and support patient evacuation.

      "news": "Dr. Wendell Roy Kingsolver, a longtime physician and advocate for family medicine and public health, especially in rural Kentucky, died Thursday, May 30. He was 95 and lived in Nicholasville.\n\nAfter graduation from the University of Kentucky and an internship and residency, Kingsolver set up a family practice at Carlisle in his home Nicholas County. He was one of the few physicians in the area and served patients of all ages at all hours in emergency, operating, and delivery rooms, He was among the first physicians certified by the American Board of Family Practice, and trained UK medical students in rural family practice as they lived in his home and learned what a diverse rural medical career was like.\n\nIn the 1960s he was a medical volunteer in the Republic of Congo, and later on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia and the Newfoundland coast town of St. Anthony. After retiring from five decades of full-time private practice, he was a public-health doctor for the Wedco District Health Department in in Nicholas, Harrison, Bourbon and Scott counties.\n\nKingsolver was an early adopter of organic farming, and he and his first wife Virginia were founding members of the Sierra Club chapter in Kentucky, the group that built Lake Carnico in Nicholas County, and the First Christian Church in Carlisle, where he was an elder and sang in the choir. He was a board member of the Cane Ridge Meeting House, where the Disciples of Christ denomination began. He enjoyed birdwatching and served a term as president of the Kentucky Ornithological Society.

      "news": "MONROE COUNTY, Mich. (WTVG) - The Monroe County Health Department has announced that it is resuming its beach monitoring program at Lake Erie beaches.\n\nEvery Tuesday, from Memorial Day through Labor Day, the Monroe County Health Department will be collecting water samples at Lake Erie beaches to determine if the water is safe for swimming. Results of the analysis will then be available the following afternoon and can be viewed on the MCHD website.\n\n\u201cAs the weather warms up, so does our Lake Erie water, attracting many swimmers to enjoy the summer weather,\u201d says Chris Westover, Environmental Health Director of the Monroe County Health Department. \u201cWe want to remind everyone to follow any whole-body contact advisories and beach closures if they occur to keep themselves and their families safe from any diseases or pathogens.\u201d\n\nMCHD says the water samples are being tested for E. coli bacteria, which live in the digestive systems of humans and other warm-blooded animals. Most strains of the E. coli bacteria are not dangerous, but they can indicate the presence of other disease-causing bacteria.\n\nThe samples are taken one foot below the surface in water that is between three and six feet deep and a minimum of three samples will be collected at each beach location.\n\nAccording to MCHD, a whole-body contact advisory will be issued if it is determined that the levels of bacteria exceed the limits established by the Michigan Public Health Code. If an advisory is posted due to bacterial contamination, MCHD will monitor the water quality at the beach and the advisory will be lifted when bacteria levels fall back within acceptable levels.\n\nMCHD says during an advisory, it is possible that a beach could be closed for swimming but other recreational activities at the beach may still be available.\n\nAny resident suspecting unsafe or unsanitary public swimming pools or beaches should contact the Environmental Health Division at 734-240-7900.\n\nFor more information about the beach monitoring program, click here.\n\nLatest Local News | First Alert Weather | Crime | National | 13abc Originals\n\nCopyright 2024 WTVG.

      "news": "Sometimes, smaller is better.\n\nFor decades, major sports leagues have tried to place teams in the country\u2019s largest markets in the hopes of selling more tickets and sponsorships as well as satisfying broadcasters who want to reach the largest number of viewers possible.\n\nBut in recent years, leagues have embraced the charms of smaller markets. Teams have moved to cities like Oklahoma City, Las Vegas and Winnipeg, Manitoba, in search of financial incentives, newer arenas and stadiums, and more devoted fans.\n\nIn early April, the National Hockey League approved the $1.2 billion sale of the Arizona Coyotes to the tech billionaire Ryan Smith and his wife, Ashley. The team, which will be renamed, will begin play next season in the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, home of one of the Smiths\u2019 other teams, the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association.\n\nOn its face, the move could be seen as a step down. Salt Lake City\u2019s metropolitan area is less than half the size of Phoenix\u2019s; Salt Lake City is the 29th-largest media market while Phoenix is the 11th largest. Utah has never been home to an N.H.L. team. But the league\u2019s decision was less about the size of Salt Lake City and more about its demographics. Like Phoenix, Salt Lake City is one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing cities. But in Utah, a thriving tech industry has attracted an influx of young workers with disposable incomes.",

      "title": "Introducing the Golazo 100 countdown: How CBS Sports ranked the best men's soccer players in the world",
      "news": "For much of the last decade plus, an exercise such as this would have seemed utterly redundant. There was really nothing to debate when it came to the question who is the greatest footballer on the planet. What a waste of hours and spreadsheets it would be to present to you all that Lionel Messi is the best in the business.\n\nNow, however, the sport is in a transitional period. The great man and his eternal rival Cristiano Ronaldo have begun their post-imperial projects, spreading the game out to its footballing backwaters. Those who were cursed to pursue greatness in the Messi age now find their lights are dimming too. As for those that follow, how can anyone hope to reach a bar raised so high?\n\nAnd so welcome to the Golazo 100, a ranking of the finest players in the men's game, with a similar women's list to follow ahead of the Olympics. Over 30 voters across CBS Sports soccer departments and the Golazo Network, including the hosts of Morning Footy -- Susannah Fuller, Charlie Davies, Nico Cantor and Alexis Guerreros -- alongside Nigel Reo-Coker, Ian Joy, Chris Wittyngham, Michael LaHoud, Jimmy Conrad, Guillem Balague and Anita Jones participated in this exercise. Each expert was handed a straightforward task: Give us the best you've got.\n\nWhat we got was a quite remarkable spread. Across their individual lists of 100 came eight different players dubbed the best in the game.\n\nOver the coming days we will unveil the best of the best, starting on Wednesday with our first 20 names. There will be surprises aplenty and plenty to debate in time for June 12, when we will name the inaugural winner of the Golazo 100.\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.

For tiebreaking purposes, if two players finished with the same number of points, the edge would go to the player with the most individual points. Fortunately, no players finished tied on points after all the votes were tallied.\n\nOver the course of voting, 297 different players received at least 1 point and the 100th player on the list got 342 points across our pool of experts.\n\nIt is no great surprise that so many had a convincing candidacy. There's not much of a spoiler alert required to have a sense of who might be there or thereabouts when we unveil the top 20 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. It took nearly 18 months for anyone to beat Rodri in a football match. Vinicius Junior has just delivered for Real Madrid in the biggest game in football, again. Harry Kane, Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe continue to top the continent's scoring charts.\n\nNone of these offer an iron clad candidacy to be the best of the best. Does it matter that all of Kane's many goals have not yet contributed to club silverware? Can the greatest in the game play the bulk of his football in a league whose competitive balance has been nerfed by his employers? Have Vinicius and Jude Bellingham spent long enough near the summit to make the last step? Is the year after the year an appropriate moment to acclaim Manchester City's Rodri, Haaland or Kevin De Bruyne?\n\nFor some of our panel these questions will have proven to be more persuasive. All of those mentioned above -- and a great many others who will sit in the top 20 -- have delivered moments of transcendent brilliance in this past season and beyond. It's just that the guy before them did that all the time.\n\nIn a fashion that only Pele and Diego Maradona have done before, Messi changed the parameters of greatness in football. None of the greats that occupy the top of the sport have a season to compare with 73 goals and 32 assists in 60 games. None of them have eight Ballon d'Ors, 12 domestic titles, a World Cup won by force of will and the 2023 Leagues Cup. None are going to match Messi.\n\nThat's where the fun lies. There are no locks anymore. When we repeat this exercise in a year's time Mbappe, Vinicius and Bellingham's collective brilliance might have spoiled their case for individual greatness a la the Kevin Durant-era Golden State Warriors. Age might have caught Kane and De Bruyne. Bukayo Saka, Florian Wirtz, Rafael Leao: All those and many more might take the last great leap. For the first time in a generation, the title of best in the world is there to be grasped.\n\nOn the outside looking in:",

      "title": "\u2018I like the chaos\u2019: how Sophia Laukli became a world-class athlete in two sports",
      "news": "For most pro athletes, racing for 11 months each year in two different sports would be daunting, if not downright exhausting. For Sophia Laulki, it offers balance.\n\nDuring the winter, Laukli races for the US ski team in the FIS Cross Country World Cup. During the summer she competes in the Golden Trail World Series against the best short distance trail runners on the planet. In between, she allows herself the decadent luxury of an entire week off.\n\n\u201cCoaches and teammates don\u2019t always understand it, but the truth is I need both to be good at either one,\u201d says Laukli. \u201cI would burn out if I did the same sport all year long.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s jarring to hear someone say they are doing more to avoid burning out, a state of affair that isn\u2019t lost on Laukli. \u201cBefore I started running competitively, I almost gave up on skiing because it was too much of the same thing,\u201d she says. \u201cDoing both means I\u2019m happier, but I do sacrifice things on the margins, like the overlap in spring and fall.\u201d\n\nHer strategy, even if it is imperfect, has worked well. Laukli, who is only 23, had banner seasons in both sports, proving she can simultaneously compete at the highest level in trail running and nordic skiing.\n\nLast summer, Laukli won a trio of famous races \u2013 the Mont Blanc Marathon, Sierre-Zinal, and Pikes Peak Ascent \u2013 before sealing the Golden Trail Championship in October. Three months later Laukli won the final stage of the Tour de Ski, making her the youngest American ever to win a World Cup race. Surprisingly, being a professional athlete was never her plan, let alone a two-sport star.\n\nLaukli grew up in Maine where her parents, Amy and Bjorn, both All-Americans in college, taught her to ski when she was two years old. However, skiing remained recreational for most of her childhood, while she focused on other sports, like soccer. \u201cSkiing would have never been as important without my parents, but having your parents as your middle school coaches is complicated at times, too,\u201d admits Laukli.\n\nInstead of focusing on skiing, Laukli dabbled. \u201cMy parents gave me a lot of freedom. They never said \u2018no\u2019 so I tried a million things. I cut off my hair, ran around the woods, rode a unicycle, made mud potions, and played with imaginary fairies. I never wanted to do what everyone was doing, because that wasn\u2019t fun. That\u2019s where my unique approach began.\u201d\n\nLaukli nearly stopped skiing as she entered high school, but her older sister convinced her to stick with it. Bob Morse, a coach of 48 years, helped her fall in love with the sport. \u201cHe created an atmosphere that was all about the team; it was more than racing for yourself,\u201d says Laukli.\n\nLaukli was the top skier in her state as a senior, but she still didn\u2019t see a future on snow. \u201cI remember watching the 2018 Olympics and not once thinking about racing in 2022,\u201d says Laukli, who would go on to represent the US in Beijing and place 15th in the 30km freestyle.\n\nHer perspective changed at Middlebury College, as she was pushed to a new level. \u201cI started improving quickly, surrounded by people who were better than me,\u201d says Laukli, who, as a freshman, qualified for FIS Junior World Championships and placed second in the 5km freestyle at NCAAs. The following year she transferred to the University of Utah and made her first start in the World Cup, a further testament to her competitive nature, which she says she inherited from her mother.\n\n\u201cWe had an unspoken competition between us all the time, especially when we were at a similar level in college,\u201d says Laukli, with a smile. \u201cI see the ways she\u2019s competitive and that\u2019s exactly how I am. When friends meet her they often say: \u2018Now I see where you get it.\u2019\u201d\n\nLaukli\u2019s parents have always been deeply invested in her career, traveling to as many of her skiing and running races as possible. \u201cWhen I was young it felt like pressure, but I now realize that they just wanted to be on the journey with me,\u201d says Laukli. \u201cNot every skier has parents as supportive as I do. They are my biggest fanboy and fangirl, which I try to never take for granted, even if it embarrasses me sometimes.\u201d\n\nIn January, as Laukli won the last stage of the Tour de Ski, the first person she saw was her dad, which seemed impossible. \u201cNobody is allowed into the finish area, not even my coach. But my dad somehow got in and I was blown away,\u201d says Laukli. \u201cI was more surprised to see him than I was to win the race.\u201d\n\nThat day made Laukli the youngest American ever to win a World Cup race, but she still feels behind peers who started skiing seriously and training year-round at a much younger age. \u201cIt\u2019s good and bad. Mostly I\u2019m grateful I came in so late, because a lot of people burn out before they reach their potential. I\u2019m still catching up on technique, but that\u2019s motivational to me. I have so much room to improve, which can play to my advantage.\u201d\n\nAs a college senior, Laukli was selected for the US Olympic team as an alternate, without guaranteed starts. After three weeks of waiting, on the last day of the Games, she was given an opportunity to race and skied well until the last lap, accidentally missing a turn near the finish and dropping a few places. \u201cThe whole experience was bittersweet. I saw the spectacle, but walked away knowing I have to come back and do better.\u201d\n\nDespite reaching the upper echelon of skiing, Laukli had long hated running. During high school summers she would find ways to avoid it. \u201cI would run when cars passed, then I\u2019d walk,\u201d she says. \u201cI would go into the woods and sit on a stump for an hour and pretend to stretch if someone passed.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until college that Laukli learned to enjoy trail running, getting to explore the mountains outside Sun Valley and Bozeman during summer camps for nordic skiing, which consisted of a variety of cross training, including trail running. A year later, while in Alaska, she signed up on a whim for Bird Ridge, a popular race outside Anchorage, and won. She then won a second race in Utah, also without training. Salomon saw a few clips of Laukli racing and reached out, offering to sponsor her with shoes and a travel stipend. Still, she entered 2022 as an unknown, but that changed quickly.\n\nLaukli started the season by winning the Broken Arrow Skyrace, one of the most prestigious races in the country. Fast forward two years, and she is regarded as one of the dominant forces in the sport and has learned a lot in the process, even when she\u2019s won.\n\n\u201cI was cocky going into Pikes Peak. I normally start with the pack and avoid being aggressive, but that day I just sent it and opened up a gap,\u201d says Laukli. \u201cEventually Judith [Wyder] caught me and I just had to hope she didn\u2019t have another gear.\u201d Laukli tucked in behind her main competition and held on until they got close to the finish, before breaking away for the win.\n\n\u201cEven though I won, it was humbling. It reminded me of my first ski races in middle school when I was getting passed by people who were training harder and smarter than me.\u201d\n\nThis trail running season, Laukli is hoping to make a statement, which she says starts with balance. \u201cToo much confidence is harmful to my performance,\u201d says Laukli. \u201cI like being nervous at the start line because it helps me race smart. If I\u2019m not nervous, I\u2019m too confident.\u201d\n\nBalance also means taking small breaks when she needs them. \u201cWhen I was younger, I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere, even for a day, where I couldn\u2019t roller ski and train,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I give myself more leniency and don\u2019t need 365 days of perfect training, which makes me less stressed in the long term.\u201d\n\nIn the big picture, Laukli is taking things one year at a time. \u201cMaybe this isn\u2019t sustainable forever, but racing is what motivates me the most right now. My schedule wouldn\u2019t work for everybody, but I like the chaos of it,\u201d says Laukli. \u201cMy big goal is to be remembered as a two-sport athlete with a unique approach.\u201d",

      "title": "Few kids are sports prodigies like Andre Agassi, but sometimes we treat them as such",
      "news": "As a boy, Andre Agassi hardly ever had a bad game.\n\nHis father, a former boxer and immigrant from Iran, saw an opportunity with tennis. He hadn't quite made it to the highest levels of his sport, but was undeterred with Andre, whom he drilled relentlessly in the desert sun of Las Vegas.\n\nMike Agassi drove his youngest child all over Nevada, Arizona and California to compete. His son won almost every time his father entered him in the 10-and-under age bracket.\n\nWhen the rare loss occurred, Agassi felt demoralized. He would slink into the car. His father would scold him for not doing what he had taught him. Or he might not say anything, his son drowning in the silence.\n\nOur sons and daughters are likely not sports prodigies like Agassi was, but sometimes we treat them as such. We invest time and money in their athletic experience. When the game or the match has ended, and we are unhappy with the outcome of it, or with how our child played, we want to \"correct\" the situation.\n\nBut before we speak, we need to consider the power our words will yield, especially if we pelt our children with criticism, or even just suggestions we consider constructive but are actually detrimental to their outlook on sports.\n\nWe think of Agassi as an eight-time Grand Slam winner. But long before that, he was a fragile kid who needed his dad to encourage him, and to understand him.\n\n\"I\u2019ve never questioned my father\u2019s love,\" Agassi would write in his autobiography, Open. \"I just wish it were softer, with more listening and less rage. In fact, I sometimes wish my father loved me less. Maybe then, he\u2019d back off, let me make my own choices.\"\n\nThe aftermath of a \"bad\" game is an ideal moment for a parent to show empathy and support. It\u2019s also a time that can push us farther away from them if we constantly try to fix them.\n\n\"What is the purpose of our relationship?\" says Ryan Maid, senior director of behavioral science for the Kansas City Royals. \"Do children want coaches or do they want parents? And what is the role of a parent? I think it's understanding those boundaries and having a clear understanding of how those boundaries play.\"\n\nUSA TODAY Sports spoke with Maid and Laurel Williams, a child and adolescent psychiatrist with Baylor College of Medicine, about steps we can take to handle that delicate space when our children are hurting after a game.\n\n1. Your son or daughter has just played a game. Allow them (and yourself) time to cool off.\n\nWe get so caught up in our kids\u2019 sports that we may not realize they are as upset about what just happened as we are.\n\nProfessional sports teams don\u2019t allow the media to speak with their players until at least 10 minutes after a game. Your kid requires more time to decompress.\n\nWhether you are a child, Navy Seal or major league baseball player (Maid has worked with all of them as a psychologist), your nervous system has to calm. Maid suggests allowing kids about 20 minutes before even bringing up the game.\n\nYou need to exhale, too. This is a period not to correct \u2013 and certainly not to punish \u2013 but to help them heal.\n\n\"Hey, I'd like to talk to you about the game,\" you could ask. \"When might be a good time?\"\n\nIf they say don\u2019t want to talk about it, wait a day. You are already empowering them with control of the situation, something Agassi never had.\n\n2. Help them normalize failure, and the way they feel about it\n\nAs a boy, Agassi won a sportsmanship trophy at a tournament he didn\u2019t win outright. His father smashed it in the parking lot, then he threw it in a dumpster.\n\nIn a dramatic way, his father was demonstrating to his son how he should feel after a loss, just as he showed him how to hit backhands.\n\nAgassi points to a moment as a boy, after a defeat in a match he felt he should have won, in which his father\u2019s feeling became his own.\n\n\"I\u2019ve internalized my father \u2013 his impatience, his perfectionisms, his rage \u2013 until his voice doesn\u2019t just feel like my own, it is my own,\" he wrote. \"I no longer need my father to torture me. From this day on, I can do it all myself.\"\n\nWe can shape our kids\u2019 sports experience by keeping it positive. We can ruin it by making it negative. Either way, we need to allow them to experience and accept failure.\n\n\"How do we build resilience?\" Maid says. \"It's understanding that failing in life is normal, failing in sport is normal.\"\n\nWe can also tell them the feelings they got from losing \u2013 mad, sad or embarrassed \u2013 are normal. But we don\u2019t always have to \"win\" to get something out of a game, or to feel something positive about being on a team.\n\nLong before she became a psychiatrist, Williams walked onto the tennis team at USC. The coach let her become a manager. She wasn't good enough to compete in matches, but she got to practice with the team every day. She was involved in something she enjoyed without facing the pressures the top six players did.\n\n\"I had a pretty solid sense of who I was,\" she says. \"I wasn't gonna become a tennis star. But I liked it. And I wanted to stay involved in it. So the idea is like, being as good as you can be is usually what I tell people. Like, what's the that best I can be at this? But I'm not only this. I\u2019m these other things too.\"\n\nCoach Steve: 70% of kids drop out of youth sports by age 13. Why?\n\n3. Remind them why they are playing sports: Because they love them\n\nThe young Agassi had a similar dalliance with soccer. He played three times a week as a boy. He loved the feeling of running up and down the field with the wind in his his hair, of calling for the ball and laughing with his teammates.\n\n\"This feels right,\" he thought. \"This feels like me.\"\n\nThe moment Mike Agassi determined soccer was infringing on his son\u2019s tennis, he pulled Andre off the field in the middle of a game. His father didn\u2019t much care for amusement through sports. This wasn\u2019t fun. It was business.\n\nAgassi never had a chance to develop a love for tennis. With his father forcing it to play, and correcting his forehand and backhand, he grew to hate it. It was a feeling he carried with him throughout his career, despite his success. Tennis was just what he did.\n\nIf we are getting our kids into sports to be professionals, or even collegiate athletes, we miss the point. Only about 1 to 2% of high school athletes get an athletic scholarship to help pay for college. Instead of chasing one, stay in sports for the reason you got into them in the first place.\n\nAs part of his work with the Royals, Maid interviews hundreds of Royals prospects ever year. Why do they play? Most of them say it's because they love it. Your kid should, too.\n\n\"When we focus so much on the pressures associated with it, children lose sight of the love of the game,\" Maid says.\n\nWe can put pressure on our children when we constantly correct. Instead, reminding them of why they play sports is important when a game doesn't go the way we had hoped it would.\n\nCoach Steve: The joy of youth sports isn't just from the results, UCLA coach says\n\n4. When our child is insecure about something, we want to reinforce, not reassure\n\nIf we love sports, we can fully benefit from the lessons they provide: Giving your best; learning how to deal with conflict; how to be a good person and teammate; how to be coachable and confident in yourself; how to have a positive attitude; and yes, how to fail.\n\nWe can reinforce these core tenets of sports, as Maid calls them, after a tough loss.\n\n\"You gave great effort today, son,\" you might say. \"And that is fantastic. You didn't win, but you played really hard. And that's what life is sometimes, we can give our best efforts and sometimes the outcome doesn\u2019t go our way.\"\n\nWe can continue to reinforce those tenets before the next game:\n\nTo reinforce is to encourage growth and development through experience. It's not the same as to reassure. To reassure can be to avoid. It\u2019s can be to tell a kid he or she played well when maybe they didn\u2019t, or to tell them they\u2019re better than they are.\n\n\"It's actually through failures that we build our self esteem,\" Williams says. \"It's not through inflatingly saying you're good at something, when maybe you're not.\"\n\nSometimes, in order to soften the feeling of failure, we give our kids a false sense of what happened, or who they are.\n\n\"We don't give them enough credit about what they know,\" Williams says. \"We're just hoping that if we say it enough times, it's true. But they're like, \u2018I'm not as good as that person. I know it.' And for you to keep saying that to me it actually erodes their trust in you. You're lying about this. So what else are you not telling me the truth about?\"\n\n5. You don't have to be a fixer. You can just be a listener.\n\n\"Oftentimes children just want somebody to listen to them,\" Maid says. \"This quote has always stuck with me: \u2018Unsolicited advice is always implied criticism.\u2019 Children who are learning to play a sport want parents to be supportive, and they want them to just process with them sometimes and just listen.\n\n\"One of the most important things that we do is listen non-judgmentally.\"\n\nMany of us take notes, physically or mentally, during games on how our kids can improve. Put those away after it's over. You can drop your suggestions into more natural setting somewhere down the line when you are casually playing catch or shooting baskets.\n\nAt the moment, resist the urge to fix the situation and just hear what your kid has to say. Maybe he or she wants to tell you they want try a different sport after the season. Or maybe they just want to vent about what happened.\n\nEither opportunity would have brightened young Andre Agassi\u2019s heart.\n\nSteve Borelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

      "title": "Wave Launches Agency to Propel Sports Properties\u2019 Social Growth",
      "news": "There has been a dramatic shift in the way social media works over recent years, with personality-follower relationships largely being replaced by platform algorithms that recommend the most engaging pieces of content they can find. That has significant ramifications for sports.\n\nWhereas users used to flock to player accounts to feel closer to the action, it\u2019s now the more faceless brands serving up the best content that win out over time. Cristiano Ronaldo has the biggest Instagram account (except for literal @Instagram), but on TikTok, it\u2019s ESPN that stands above all other names in sports. There\u2019s a new opportunity, then, for organizations that own intellectual property even if they can\u2019t lay claim to diehard fans\u2019 hearts. On Tuesday, digital sports media company Wave Sports + Entertainment announced a new division, Wave Media Agency, to help global sports properties get the most out of their online accounts.\n\nFounded in 2017 to provide sports-related videos for Gen Z social media users, Wave now boasts 130 million engaged followers, with an expanded portfolio that includes digital series such as New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce.

Wave has been supporting third-party accounts on a more informal basis previously; the company claims to have helped generate 1 billion views across social media for league partners.\n\nThe companies coming to Wave are looking to acquire new fans, strengthen relationships with existing followers, and\u2014notably\u2014generate revenue as social moves from being a marketing-focused engagement platform to a money-driving distribution tool. The content Wave intends to create and publish on a variety of digital sites such as YouTube and Snapchat stretches from short-form behind-the-scenes and archival clips to multi-episode digital docuseries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s marrying our production and distribution expertise to ultimately help the top leagues, rightsholders and sports properties reach, engage and\u2014equally as important\u2014to monetize this next generation of fans,\u201d Verne said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s been a culmination of the last seven years.\u201d",

      "title": "Beyond Sports Wins Three Sports Emmy Awards",
      "news": "Beyond Sports Wins Three Sports Emmy Awards\n\nStory Highlights\n\nBeyond Sports took home three major awards at the Sports Emmy Awards ceremony in New York. The awards were won in collaboration with broadcaster ESPN for the innovative alternative broadcast of an NFL game: Toy Story Funday Football. During this broadcast, TV viewers had the chance to watch an animated Toy Story version of an American football game. It was simultaneously aired with the regular game on ESPN+ and Disney+ to engage new and diverse audiences with the sport. Beyond Sports and ESPN were nominated and won in three categories: \u2018Outstanding Studio or Production Design/Art Direction\u2019, \u2018The George Wensel Technical Achievement Award\u2019, and \u2018Outstanding Graphic Design \u2013 Event/Show\u2019.\n\nThe Sports Emmy Awards are presented by The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS). Under the watchful eye of more than 1,200 prominent \ufb01gures from the American sports world, awards were given in various categories.\n\nCreating enthusiasm under new demographics enthusiasm\n\nThanks to Beyond Sports\u2019 expertise in visualizing sports, TV viewers could watch an animated Toy Story version of the American football game between the Atlanta Falcons and the Jacksonville Jaguars. This was broadcast on October 1st, 2023 on ESPN+ and Disney+ while the traditional broadcast was simultaneously aired on ESPN\u2019s main channel. By utilizing Hawk-Eye Innovations Skeletal and Next Gen Stats single-point tracking data, Beyond Sports transformed the live feed into a 3D environment of Andy\u2019s room, a character from Toy Story. All the well-known characters from the \ufb01lm and various recognizable elements from Toy Story were featured in the broadcast. This approach appealed to a new and more diverse audience and pulled more interest in the sport among existing fans. It was ultimately the most-watched live broadcast on ESPN+ and Disney+ ever.\n\nSander Schouten, Managing Director and Co-Founder of Beyond Sports: \u201cWhen Nicolaas and I founded Beyond Sports ten years ago, winning three Emmy Awards in one evening was something we never imagined. We are incredibly proud of this achievement. It is a compliment to the entire team that worked so hard on this project. With the Toy Story Football Funday broadcast, we bridge the gap between sports, technology, and entertainment. We reached a new audience in their own environment and on their terms. Instead of adapting the original TV broadcast, we offered them a place where they felt at home. This allowed us to help the NFL engage a new audience and bring people together around an NFL game.\u201d\n\nRecognition for innovation\n\nBeyond Sports previously won two Emmy Awards in 2021 for a broadcast with CBS Sports and Nickelodeon. In November 2022, Beyond Sports was acquired by SONY SPORTS to further strengthen the organization\u2019s sports activities and create new sports entertainment that bridges the gap between live and virtual worlds.\n\nNicolaas Westerhof, Technical Director and Co-Founder of Beyond Sports: \u201cIn recent years, Beyond Sports\u2019 technology has advanced signi\ufb01cantly, partly thanks to the economies of scale that SONY SPORTS provides. We are therefore particularly proud to bring home the George Wensel Technical Achievement Award. This award recognizes the innovative technology that Beyond Sports developed for the broadcast. We have just returned from the US and look forward to celebrating the success with the entire team in Alkmaar!\u201d",

      "news": "\u2013 Indiana State finished third overall in the Missouri Valley Conference All-Sports Championship standings as announced by the conference office last week.The Sycamores led the way among conference institutions winning a league-high six MVC first-place finishes on their way to recording their best finish since the 2020-21 season. ISU took swept the men's indoor and outdoor track & field championships, the women's indoor and outdoor track & field championships, and claimed regular season titles in both men's basketball and baseball to highlight the year.Drake earned regular-season team titles this year in men's cross country, women's basketball, women's soccer, and tournament titles in women's basketball and men's basketball. Notably, Drake became the first institution in MVC history to win back-to-back tournament titles in both men's and women's basketball. In addition to the five team titles, Drake had top-five finishes in men's basketball (regular-season), men's golf, men's outdoor track & field, men's indoor track & field, women's cross country, women's golf, women's tennis, and volleyball. Drake had an aggregate score of 8.787 this year to take the title. The Bulldogs finished third in 2022-23, which was its highest finish since 1994-95.Illinois State had one team title (women's golf) and added top-four finishes in baseball, men's cross country, men's outdoor track & field, men's indoor track & field, women's cross country, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, women's outdoor track & field, and women's indoor track & field, to yield an aggregate score of 8.442 to finish second. Indiana State, meanwhile, recorded six MVC first-place finishes to take third in the standings at 8.148. Belmont finished fourth or better in eight sports and finished fourth in the standings (7.696). Missouri State (7.463) and Southern Illinois (7.411) rounded out the league's top-six finishers.Ten different institutions claimed at least one regular-season league title this past season. Indiana State's six total titles led the league.8.787 -- Drake (5)8.442 -- Illinois State (1)7.696 -- Belmont (1)7.463 -- Missouri State (1)7.411 -- Southern Illinois (3)*combined regular-season and tournament championshipsIllinois State, Missouri State or Wichita State, meanwhile, had earned the league's all-sports championship trophy every year since 1995. Illinois State won five of six all-sports championships from 1996-01, Missouri State has five titles since 1999-00, and Wichita State had a stretch where it won 11 of 14 all-sports trophies from 2003-04 through 2016-17. Notably, Illinois State has 16 all-sports crowns and has finished first, second, or third in 30 of the past 33 years.The All-Sports Trophy is based on a school's average finish in each of the sponsored championships by the Missouri Valley Conference. Teams are awarded 12 points for first, 11 for second, 10 for third, etc., and the total accumulated points are divided by the number of sports in which a particular school competes. For sports not sponsored by every MVC school, the points decrease by number of competing schools (i.e., in a sport where 10 teams compete, 12/10 = 1.20, so point totals decrease by 1.20; 1st = 12, 2nd = 10.8, 3rd = 9.6, etc.)Finishes in baseball, basketball, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball are based on regular-season competition. However, institutions receive three bonus points for each league post-season championship earned in those aforementioned sports. All other sports are determined by finish at the championship tournament or championship meet.For the latest information on the Sycamore Athletics, make sure to check out GoSycamores.com .

      "news": "Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.\n\nWhen Emmanuel Morgan was hired as a sports reporter covering the N.F.L. and combat sports for The New York Times in 2021, the job felt familiar.

      "title": "Big Ten, SEC demands for College Football Playoff bids on pause as leaders look to assess future landscape",
      "news": "The pause button has been hit on one of the biggest college football stories in 2024, and it's largely flown under the radar.\n\nEarlier this year, the Big Ten and SEC were in the process of what amounted to a hostile takeover of the College Football Playoff. Already succeeding in securing a combined 59% of media rights revenue under the new CFP contract with ESPN, they also socialized the idea of essentially taking over the bracket.\n\nThe reaction from within the system was far from positive. The attempted coup peaked -- or hit rock bottom depending on how you view it -- in February with reports the two super conferences were attempting to grab the top two spots in the playoff for their respective champions beginning in 2026 when the new contract goes into effect.\n\nThat was in addition to seeking three automatic qualifiers each for the two leagues. Final tally: 10 combined spots between the Big Ten and SEC.\n\n\"I didn't agree with it,\" one administrator in the room at the time told CBS Sports this week. \"It would potentially de-legitimize the playoff to some degree. No league has that. No league gives you a lot of [access] because you have money.\"\n\nPushback from the rest of college football was so significant that such talk diminished before flaming out altogether. In fact, a settlement of the issue -- perhaps expected when CFP leaders meet again in September -- looks like it will be delayed.\n\nThe 10 FBS conferences plus Notre Dame have seemingly agreed to let this season play out under the 12-team format before making any further decisions about structure for 2026 and beyond. Beyond 2026, virtually everything is on the table including possible expansion of the field to 14 and beyond.\n\n\"I'm just a humble one of 11,\" SEC commissioner Greg Sankey said last week. \"I thought it would be wise to get through this year. I don't think we should be looking at format before we have a 12-team experience.\"\n\nLet's have a deeper look at why the once-aggressive talks of expanding the CFP sooner rather than later have cooled.\n\n5+7 model works ... for now: The default playoff setting is the one debuting this season -- a 12-team bracket with the five highest-ranked conference champions earning an automatic berth. The top four teams earn a first-round bye, which leaves seven at-large teams. For context, here's how a 12-team field would have looked last season.\n\n\"I think the selection committee and the CFP Management Committee [commissioners] have to cope with what that means, those seven non-conference champion teams that participate,\" Sankey said.\n\nWith the dissolution of the Pac-12, those five AQs at the top have essentially become the Power Four champions (Big Ten, SEC, ACC, Big 12) + 1. In most years, that \"+1\" looks like it may eventually become the Mountain West champion should the conference add Oregon State and Washington State as full members in 2026.\n\nThe ongoing issue is those seven at-large teams. SEC power brokers have already given some thought on which way those should go.\n\nBig Ten and SEC make out in any scenario: Sankey remains on record as saying he has no problem with all at-large teams, and it's easy to see why he's taken that stance. Big Ten and SEC teams will fill the bracket no matter the format. Why rush into formalizing it? If the current 12-team format was in place last season, 10 of the 14 teams would have been from those two conferences.\n\nIn making their case for that 58% of the revenue, the Big Ten and SEC noted that they had accounted for 29 of the 40 CFP berths (72.5%) in the first 10 years (2014-2023). Yet, they only received 33% of the revenue. In this expansion era, they're going to get paid ... it's just a matter of how much.\n\n\"To start talking about expanding it to whatever number, let's see how successful this is,\" said Mississippi State president Mark Keenum, chair of the CFP Board of Managers. \"I think [the expanded playoff] will be extremely successful. It has been well received by our fan base around the country. If our coaches like it, the format, the dates [that's good]. You're always going to think about options for making it better and expanding. But, my goodness, it hasn't even started yet.\"\n\nHouse v. NCAA settlement: College athletics was driven into a ditch last month by the House vs. NCAA settlement. That distracted everyone in the college space. For all the legal levers yet to be pulled in the settlement, it was easy to push the CFP's future into the background. Actually, every other NCAA/collegiate discussion is secondary at this point with pay-for-play, unionization and wildly impacted budgets all in play.\n\nThe settlement and its implications were the talk of SEC spring meetings last week in Destin, Florida. No one had definitive answers. There was plenty of hand-wringing. The uncertainly is likely to last throughout this year, at least.\n\nForget the CFP. There might not be an NCAA by this time next year.\n\nLitigation: The Florida attorney general continues an anti-trust investigation into the CFP after Florida State was excluded from the 2023 field. Remember?\n\nThe AG is seeking records -- if any exist -- on how the 13-person selection committee arrived at its final decision to leave out an undefeated Power Five conference champion. This comes at a time when veteran CFP executive director Bill Hancock is stepping down, being replaced by Air Force Academy superintendent Richard Clark.\n\nImagine having that paperwork sitting on your desk during your first days in office.\n\nYeah, the action is probably petty, frivolous and grandstanding, but these days you ignore such litigation at your own risk. CBS Sports previously reported at least one of those selection committee members didn't think FSU could win without injured quarterback Jordan Travis.\n\nSelection committee criteria states it is allowed to consider the \"unavailability of key players \u2026 that likely will affect its postseason performance.\"\n\nSure, but should it when that team is 13-0 and won its conference without the star quarterback at the end of the season?\n\nIt was later revealed members of the selection committee were assigned security after threats from FSU fans.\n\nConference realignment: Why address CFP structure and format when college football as a whole may not be done with realignment. Florida State's dogged effort to get out of the ACC threatens to trigger the next round of consolidation. FSU's departure would diminish, if not cripple, the league. We've already seen the Pac-12 dissolve.\n\nThis promises to be a bitter legal battle that could take years. Or not. The next date to watch is Aug. 15 when FSU is required to give the ACC one year's notice of its intention to leave the conference. Clemson, which has filed its own lawsuit to get out of the league, is watching closely. After FSU, North Carolina might be one of the most valued brands for any conference.\n\nHow do you decide on automatic qualifiers when you don't know how many conferences will exist?\n\nOpt outs/collective bargaining/unions: The CFP could be impacted by any or all of those factors in the future. We've already told you about the likelihood of top draft choices possibly skipping the playoff games. Opt outs are already an issue among the rank-and-file bowls.\n\nIf opt outs become a trend, the CFP may have to do something because losing even one high draft choice impacts the playoff's credibility. A start-up basketball tournament in Las Vegas intends to share NIL money with the players. Could the CFP be moved to do something similar?",

      "title": "USF\u2019s breakthrough sports year capped by track and field resurgence",
      "news": "TAMPA \u2014 His track and field odyssey, with its myriad turns, straightaways and hurdles, has evolved into a Walter Mitty existence, a surreal journey with a stopwatch.\n\nAs a senior at Panhandle powerhouse Quincy Shanks in 1995, Erik Jenkins competed for iconic coach James Pelham and helped lead the Tigers to a Class 4A state title alongside boyhood friend Dexter Jackson, the Super Bowl 37 MVP as a Bucs safety. At Western Kentucky, he learned under another legend \u2014 Hilltoppers coach Curtiss Long \u2014 and befriended the school\u2019s slender, shifty quarterback, Willie Taggart.\n\nThen as the Hilltoppers coach for 11 seasons, his competed against \u2014 and culled wisdom from \u2014 Middle Tennessee\u2019s Dean Hayes, a hallowed name in track and field circles who led the Blue Raiders to 21 NCAA top-25 finishes in a 57-year career.\n\n\u201cOne of the coolest things was, one day (Taggart) and I were just out at the (Western Kentucky) facilities and we\u2019re both standing on the field,\u201d Jenkins recalled. \u201cI\u2019m getting ready to go to track practice and he\u2019s getting ready to go to football practice and he said, \u2018Man, can you believe we\u2019re both head coaches here?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLike Taggart, Jenkins\u2019 journey has led him to the bay area. And similar to his college pal, he has resuscitated the fortune of a once-foundering Bulls program. But whereas Taggart bolted USF with Usain Bolt briskness for a Power Five opportunity, Jenkins speaks like a guy just rounding the initial turn in Tampa.\n\nWhich is to say, USF track and field \u2014 on the final stretch of a breakthrough season that has included American Athletic Conference men\u2019s indoor and outdoor titles \u2014 might just be getting started.\n\n\u201cI think any place can be a sleeping giant, but it takes the right person, the right resources, and if you\u2019re into athletics, it takes the right administration, the right coaches,\u201d said Jenkins, a 47-year-old married dad of three wrapping up his fifth season at USF.\n\n\u201cAnd I felt that in (USF athletic director) Michael Kelly, I had the right administrator at the top, and he was willing to listen.\u201d\n\nJenkins is taking 12 Bulls athletes (eight men, four women) to this week\u2019s NCAA Championships in Eugene, Oregon, a 3,000-mile trek symbolic in itself: The journey to this national stage included no shortcuts.\n\nUpon his hiring in the summer of 2019, Jenkins \u2014 a long jumper and sprinter in a previous life \u2014 first had to foster confidence in a program that had none. The season prior to his arrival, USF\u2019s men had placed seventh in the American Athletic Conference indoor and outdoor meets, the women 12th.\n\n\u201cYou see it in the hallways,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cYou can say it all the time, but they just didn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak also set him back. Then he had to sell his athletes on a rugged fall program that created a degree of attrition.\n\nAnd much like on-campus peers Alex Golesh (football) and Amir Abdur-Rahim (men\u2019s basketball), Jenkins had to replenish his roster via the portal. Eighteen athletes in his program (nine men, nine women) transferred from NCAA four-year schools. A handful of others came from the junior college and NAIA levels.\n\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\u2019s college football teams every day.

Explore all your options\n\nWhen asked to identify Jenkins\u2019 greatest attribute, two of those transfers \u2014 men\u2019s NCAA qualifiers Shevioe Reid and Abdul-Rasheed Saminu \u2014 uttered the same one-word response, in separate interviews:\n\nDiscipline.\n\n\u201cHe will hit you with the training,\u201d said Saminu, a Ghana native who won AAC outdoor titles in the 100 and 200 meters and 4x100-meter relay.\n\n\u201cWe have a long season so far. Fall was a very good program; our fall training was a little bit too much on us, but when you sit down and look at it ... oh my god, it\u2019s a good program. Everybody\u2019s feeling good, everybody\u2019s feeling happy to compete. Your body\u2019s ready.\u201d\n\nThe results are unmistakable. The men\u2019s indoor and outdoor AAC titles were the program\u2019s first conference championships, while the women placed third in both meets after never finishing better than fourth in either meet in the league\u2019s 11-year history.\n\nAdditionally, 35 total indoor and outdoor school records (21 men, 14 women) have been set on Jenkins\u2019 watch, and the 12 athletes headed to nationals is a program record.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no easy way to put it \u2014 we work,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t get away from that. And that\u2019s not for everybody, and we\u2019re trying to identify people who understand that we are going to work. We\u2019re not going to shy away from it, and we\u2019re going to expect you to do certain things the right way.\u201d\n\nMeantime, the investment into the program has been reciprocated by the administration. A resurfacing of the Bulls\u2019 home track and field stadium was the initial phase in a three-phase renovation that will include new locker rooms, as well as a new press box and video board.\n\nAnd presumably, wall space for freshly minted conference title banners.\n\n\u201c(Kelly) has been true to the things he said he was going to do, and I\u2019ve tried to be true to the things I said I could do,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re now starting to scratch the surface of where South Florida can go for a long time.\u201d\n\nContact Joey Knight at jknight@tampabay.com.

      "news": "Mike Joy, Fox Sports\u2019 lead NASCAR play-by-play announcer, says he intends to return to the booth next year as the network starts the sport\u2019s new media rights cycle.\n\n\n\nJoy has been the voice of Fox\u2019s NASCAR efforts since the network began airing the sport in 2001. But Fox Sports, part of the publicly traded Fox Corp., is making several changes to its coverage for next year as the new seven-year media cycle through 2031 begins. That has raised questions about the future of the network\u2019s NASCAR talent.\n\n\n\nJoy\u2019s deal with Fox is said to be up after this year, and it was unclear whether he had signed a contract extension, but his wishes would likely carry some weight with Fox executives given his tenure and prominence.\n\n\n\nAsked about his status for 2025, Joy wrote in a text message: \u201cLooking forward to next year.\u201d Fox Sports, which has yet to formally announce its booth for 2025, said it doesn\u2019t comment on contract negotiations.\n\n\n\nJoy is part of a three-man booth with former drivers Kevin Harvick and Clint Bowyer. Harvick just began a multiyear deal with Fox Sports this year and is set to return next year. Bowyer\u2019s status with the network after this year was unclear.\n\n\n\nJoy called his 45th Daytona 500 this past February, and he\u2019s been covering NASCAR since 1977.\n\n\n\nNASCAR will have five media partners starting next year, a dramatic increase from just two under the current rights deal. The two incumbents in Fox and NBC renewed but for fewer races while The CW, Prime Video and Warner Bros. Discovery will be part of the next cycle.\n\n\n\nNASCAR will make $7.7 billion in total from the deals, a 40% increase from the last cycle, SBJ first reported in November.\n\n\n\nFox\u2019s final Cup Series race of the 2024 season is this weekend at Sonoma Raceway in California. Next week, NBC Sports will take over by airing the first-ever Cup race at Iowa Speedway.\n\n\n\n",

      "news": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) - The Rattler community is mourning a loss.\n\nEddie Jackson, president of the 220 Quarterback Club and Florida A&M University alum, died Monday at the age of 86, according to the university\u2019s Tuesday statement.\n\n\u201cFAMU lost a loyal son and one of its strongest and most effective advocates,\u201d FAMU President Larry Robinson said. \u201cEddie Jackson loved FAMU and FAMU loved him back.

      "title": "MLB's ineligible list: Tucupita Marcano becomes latest to get lifetime ban from commissioner Rob Manfred",
      "news": "Major League Baseball announced on Tuesday that injured San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano has been permanently banned after violating the league's gambling policy. (Marcano was one of five players disciplined for gambling-related violations.) A league investigation found that Marcano had placed nearly 400 bets on baseball games, including MLB and international contests, and that he had gambled on games involving his team, then the Pittsburgh Pirates, while he was on the IL.\n\nMLB allows uniform personnel to partake in sports gambling, provided that it is legal in their territory and that the personnel do not place bets on the diamond sports (baseball and softball). The other four players suspended on Tuesday were given year-long banishments since they did not gamble on games played by their own team -- a line that Marcano crossed with his Pirates bets. Although Marcano was not active at the time (he suffered a torn ACL last July), betting on games that he had a direct tie to violated MLB Rule 21, which states that \"any player, umpire, or club or League official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform, shall be declared permanently ineligible.\"\n\nMarcano, 24, appeared in 149 big-league games during his career. He hit .217/.269/.320 (63 OPS+) with five home runs, seven stolen bases, and 34 runs batted in. Far more notable than what he did on the field is what he signifies off it: the latest individual to be placed on the restricted list by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred. Indeed, Manfred has made full use of the restricted list during his tenure, policing the league by preventing at least eight individuals from having any involvement in MLB.\n\nIn light of Marcano's inclusion in that group, we here at CBS Sports felt this would be a fitting occasion to recap those individuals and how they ended up on the list.\n\nJenrry Mej\u00eda\n\nMej\u00eda became the first player in MLB history to be suspended for life over performance-enhancing drug use in 2016, when he recorded his third positive test. Mej\u00eda had, to that point, appeared in 113 big-league games and had amassed a 3.68 ERA and 28 saves. He would have his lifetime ban lifted in summer 2018, and he would go on to make minor-league appearances for the Mets and Red Sox. He would, however, never again pitch in the majors because of performance reasons. He remains active to this day, pitching for the Saraperos de Saltillo of the Mexican League.\n\nChris Correa\n\nIn what will serve as a common theme in this piece, Correa was not a player but an executive. During his time as the Cardinals scouting director, he improperly accessed an Astros internal database, believing that former Cardinals executive Jeff Luhnow (then the Astros general manager) had stolen proprietary information. Correa was not only banned for life by MLB, he was sentenced to 46 months in prison, having violated federal laws in the process. There's no indication that Correa has been reinstated or sought to be allowed back.\n\nJohn Coppolella\n\nMLB banished Coppolella, then the Braves general manager, in November 2017 after it was found that he had circumvented the league's rules on international signing limits. (The Braves were also forced to release 12 players, including hyped shortstops Kevin Mait\u00e1n and Ji Hwan Bae, the latter of whom subsequently rose to the majors as a member of the Pirates. Coppolella was officially reinstated by MLB back in January 2023, but he's yet to rejoin an organization.\n\nBrandon Taubman\n\nTaubman is yet another executive. Formerly an assistant general manager with the Astros, he was fired in October 2019 after making inappropriate remarks toward female reporters following a Houston playoff victory. Taubman was said to have yelled \"Thank God we got Osuna! I'm so [expletive] glad we got Osuna!\" in reference to closer Roberto Osuna, who the Astros had acquired in controversial fashion following his 75-game suspension for violating MLB's domestic violence policy. Taubman was reportedly reinstated by MLB in 2020, though he's yet to publicly resurface in a front office.\n\nRoberto Alomar\n\nAlomar, a Hall of Fame second baseman, was placed on the restricted list in May 2021 after a league investigation into alleged sexual misconduct toward an industry employee in 2014. Although Alomar remained enshrined in Cooperstown, he was removed from the Blue Jays' \"Level of Excellence\" and resigned from the Hall of Fame's Board of Directors. There's no indication that Alomar has sought or been granted reinstatement.\n\nMickey Callaway\n\nCallaway was also placed on the ineligible list in May 2021 following a league investigation into alleged lewd conduct toward women that included inappropriate text messages and comments. Callaway, who had previously managed the Mets, was at the time serving as the pitching coach for the Angels. As with Alomar, there's no indication that Callaway has attempted to be reinstated by MLB.\n\nJared Porter\n\nPorter was placed on the ineligible list in July 2021 after it was reported that he had sent a woman reporter 62 consecutive unanswered text messages. Porter, who had served as the Mets general manager, was to be ineligible through the 2022 season, at which point he could apply to be reinstated. It's unclear if he has applied for reinstatement in the year and a half since.\n\nTucupita Marcano\n\nWe conclude with where we started. At present, there's no way of knowing if Marcano will ever be reinstated by Manfred, or if his banishment from the game over gambling violations will stand the test of time, the way that Pete Rose's (among others) have throughout baseball history. If nothing else, Marcano has assured himself a place in baseball lore, albeit for the wrong reasons.",

      "news": "Cameron Heyward has returned to the Steelers' facility for the third and final week of the team's OTAs. The six-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman missed the first two weeks of OTAs as he is hoping for a contract extension. Heyward's current deal is set to expire after the 2024 season.\n\n\"I have always attended (OTAs), but at this time, it's just contract negotiations,\" Heyward recently said on his Not Just Football podcast. \"Ya know, I want to be a Pittsburgh Steeler, but we'll see what happens.\"\n\nHeyward, 35, is entering the final year of a four-year, $64 million extension he signed in September 2020. Heyward's age, however, and the fact that he is coming off an injury-marred 2023 season may be among the reasons why he and the Steelers have yet to come to terms on an extension.\n\nPrior to last season, Heyward was playing at a level that saw him get selected to six straight Pro Bowls from 2017-22. He was also a three-time All-Pro over that span while establishing himself as one of the NFL's premier defensive players. Heyward enters the 2024 season tied with James Harrison with the second-most career sacks (80.5) in franchise history behind only teammate T.J. Watt (96.5 sacks).\n\nWhile the Steelers value Heyward, it's clear that Pittsburgh is making more business than personal decisions these days under third-year general manager Omar Khan. Along with Heyward's current situation, the Steelers recently declined to pick up running back Najee Harris' fifth-year option despite his considerable success during his first three years with the Steelers.\n\nLike Harris, Heyward may have to earn an extension offer by his performance in 2024, assuming that Heyward is willing to play this season without an extension.",

      "news": "The Athletics have not yet officially moved to Las Vegas or even to Sacramento, their temporary home for at least the next three seasons, yet they already have their eyes on playing games in other markets. According to the team's proposed 30-year non-relocation agreement, obtained by the Nevada Independent, the Athletics are \"requesting to play up to eight home games a season away from the team's future $1.5 billion Las Vegas ballpark.\"\n\nThe Las Vegas Stadium Authority board is slated to vote on the arrangement on July 18.\n\nAthletics president Dave Kaval claims that the team wants to play neutral site home games in order to build the franchise's brand and to attract players and sponsors. It's unclear where, precisely, the A's intend to play those games -- be it domestically or internationally. It's also unclear that any player would be more inclined to join a franchise because they played 10% of their home schedule elsewhere; generally speaking, players prefer franchises that are willing to pay them market value, something the Athletics haven't been willing to do in quite some time.\n\nSteve Hill, the chairman of the Stadium Authority, told the Independent that the Athletics might have to reduce their requested amount of non-Vegas home games so that it doesn't impact their bonding capacity -- money that the team seeks to build the stadium in the first place. The number of home games played directly correlates to the bonding capacity, Hill said. (The Athletics are also, as of recently, seeking minority investors in an effort to raise an estimated $500 million for the stadium's construction. They're still believed to be on schedule to open come 2028.)\n\nMajor League Baseball typically allows teams to play up to four home games elsewhere. In recent years, MLB has been more proactive about playing international contests, like the Seoul and London series, although those series tend to often run just two games in length.",

      "news": "Scottie Scheffler will likely be among the popular daily Fantasy golf picks for the 2024 Memorial Tournament. Scheffler is the No. 1 ranked player in the world and he's already secured four victories this season. He's finished T-2 or better in six of his last seven starts on the PGA Tour and he recorded a third-place finish at the Memorial Tournament in 2023. However, daily Fantasy golf players will have to decide if he's worth the high price tag when setting their PGA DFS lineups for the 2024 Memorial Tournament, which gets underway from Muirfield Village Golf Club on Thursday, June 6.\n\nScheffler is the highest-priced player on both FanDuel and DraftKings and he enters this week's event ranked 75th in strokes gained: putting (0.100). Should Scheffler be part of your PGA DFS strategy for the Memorial Tournament 2024, or is it time to fade him in favor of a player with a significantly lower price tag? Before you lock in your PGA DFS picks for the 2024 Memorial Tournament, you'll want to see the latest daily Fantasy golf picks, advice, and player pool from SportsLine's Mike McClure.\n\nMcClure is a DFS pro with over $2 million in career winnings, and he's been red-hot on his PGA Tour picks this season. McClure is also a predictive data engineer at SportsLine who uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every tournament 10,000 times, taking factors like statistical trends, past results, and current form into account. This allows him to find the best PGA DFS values and create optimal lineups that he shares only over at SportsLine. They're a must-see for any PGA DFS player.\n\nLast week at the RBC Canadian Open, McClure identified Mackenzie Hughes as one of his top PGA DFS picks. The result: Hughes secured a T-7 finish after shooting 10-under par. Anybody who included him in their lineups was well on the way to a profitable weekend.\n\nIn addition, McClure's model is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since June 2020, nailing tournament after tournament. This same model has also nailed a whopping 12 majors entering the weekend, including three straight Masters and the 2024 PGA Championship. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow, McClure has set his sights on the 2024 Memorial Tournament and revealed his optimal PGA DFS advice, strategy, and player pool. Head to SportsLine now to see his top golf DFS picks for the Memorial Tournament 2024.\n\nTop 2024 Memorial Tournament PGA DFS picks\n\nOne of McClure's top PGA DFS picks for the 2024 Memorial Tournament is Tony Finau at $7,900 on DraftKings and $9,800 on FanDuel. Finau's game is trending in the right direction after finishing T-18 or better in three of his last four starts on the PGA Tour.\n\nThe 34-year-old has all the tools needed to return solid value for your PGA DFS lineups this week. In fact, Finau is currently ranked fifth in strokes gained: approach to green (0.786), 11th in greens in regulation percentage (69.95%), 16th in birdie average (4.30) and 18th in total driving (105). Those impressive stats make Finau a complete steal at this price point, so confidently lock him in your PGA DFS lineups.\n\nMcClure's optimal PGA DFS strategy also includes rostering Justin Thomas at $9,200 on DraftKings and $10,800 on FanDuel.\n\nIn order to score well at Muirfield Village, players will need to be extremely accurate with their irons. Thomas enters this week's event ranked seventh in strokes gained: approach to green (0.697). He's also been effective off the tee, ranking 22nd in driving distance (308.1) and 38th in total driving (132). His ability to constantly put himself in advantageous positions has the 31-year-old ranked seventh in birdie average (4.43) and 17th in scoring average (69.57), which will make him a valuable PGA DFS asset this week. See who else to back right here.\n\nHow to set 2024 Memorial Tournament DFS lineups\n\nMcClure is also targeting an undervalued player who's primed to play well, giving you a huge return on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel. Picks like these could be the difference between winning your PGA DFS contests or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is here.\n\nSo what are the top PGA DFS picks for the Memorial Tournament 2024, and which undervalued golfer is a must-roster?

      "news": "Welcome to the Tuesday edition of the Pick Six newsletter!\n\nI'm not saying we need an offseason version of the RedZone Channel, but it would be nice to have one this week because I'm pretty sure that's the only way that anyone can possibly keep track of everything that's happening in the NFL over the next few days. Starting today, mandatory minicamps will be kicking off for a total of 10 different teams, which is notable because minicamp is the only set of practices during the entire offseason that every player on the roster is required to attend.\n\nBefore this week, every practice was voluntary, but for minicamp, attendance is mandatory and players will get hit with a hefty fine if they don't show up. This is where you find out how real the drama is between a player and his team, and right now, things aren't looking so great for the Cowboys. CeeDee Lamb isn't expected to attend minicamp this week, which is a decision that will cost him a lot of money.\n\nBasically, there will be a lot going on over the next few days just like we have a lot going on in today's newsletter.\n\nAs always, here's your daily reminder to tell all your friends to sign up for the newsletter. Actually, you don't even have to tell all of your friends; just tell two of your friends and I'll be happy. To get them signed up, all you have to do is click here.\n\n1. C.J. Stroud fires shots at Aaron Rodgers with three interesting takes\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Houston Texans and New York Jets don't have a rivalry right now, but they might have one going forward after some recent comments that C.J Stroud made about Aaron Rodgers.\n\nDuring a recent interview on the Million Dollaz Worth of Game podcast, the Texans quarterback mentioned Rodgers multiple times and it wasn't exactly in a positive manner.\n\nHere are the three hottest takes that Stroud had about Rodgers.\n\nStroud said he'd take Eli Manning's career over Rodgers. At one point during the podcast, Stroud was asked if he would rather have Eli Manning's career or Rodgers' career and he didn't hesitate with his answer. \"You want the rings, Eli got two,\" Stroud said.\n\nAt one point during the podcast, Stroud was asked if he would rather have Eli Manning's career or Rodgers' career and he didn't hesitate with his answer. \"You want the rings, Eli got two,\" Stroud said. Stroud has a theory on why Rodgers only has one Super Bowl win. At another point in the podcast, Stroud insinuated that the reason Rodgers only has one Super Bowl win is because he might not be such a good teammate. \"You know what I think it is? I've talked to Tom Brady about this because he's a good mentor to me,\" Stroud said, via Athlon Sports. \"What he told me is his teammates, and how he treats his teammates. And that's where I think it falls off for Rodgers. We don't know how Aaron Rodgers treats his teammates, but you can guarantee that Tom Brady treats his teammates right because how he got those rings.\"\n\nAt another point in the podcast, Stroud insinuated that the reason Rodgers only has one Super Bowl win is because he might not be such a good teammate. \"You know what I think it is? I've talked to Tom Brady about this because he's a good mentor to me,\" Stroud said, via Athlon Sports. \"What he told me is his teammates, and how he treats his teammates. And that's where I think it falls off for Rodgers. We don't know how Aaron Rodgers treats his teammates, but you can guarantee that Tom Brady treats his teammates right because how he got those rings.\" Matthew Stafford would have more rings if he had been in Rodgers' situation. Stroud said that if someone like Matthew Stafford had been given the same supporting cast as Rodgers throughout his career that he would have done much better. \"If you give Matthew Stafford a chance like Aaron Rodgers had, I guarantee you he might have had more rings,\" Stroud said. \"I'd say he would have like three or four [rings].\"\n\nWhat this all means is that you should go ahead and circle Halloween night on your calendar right now, because that's when the Jets will be hosting the Texans on \"Thursday Night Football.\"\n\nYou can check out Stroud's full comments here.\n\n2. Ranking most vulnerable division winners: Cowboys at the top\n\nIf there's one thing I can promise you about the 2024 NFL season, it's that we won't see every division winner from the 2023 season repeat as champion in 2024. Roger Goodell would quit his job before he'd let that happen.\n\nThe NFL is driven by parity and that parity is why Cody Benjamin decided to rank the most vulnerable division winners heading into the upcoming season. Basically, he took the eight division winners from 2023 and ranked them based on which team is most likely NOT to repeat as champion in 2024.\n\nLet's check out his list:\n\n1. NFC East: Cowboys\n\n2. NFC South: Buccaneers\n\n3. AFC East: Bills\n\n4. AFC North: Ravens\n\n5. NFC North: Lions\n\n6. AFC South: Texans\n\n7. NFC West: 49ers\n\n8. AFC West: Chiefs\n\nThe fact that the Cowboys are at the top isn't a huge surprise considering their hasn't been a repeat champion in the NFC East SINCE 2004.\n\nBased on Cody's list, the two teams that played in last year's Super Bowl are the most likely to repeat as champions in 2024. If you want to check out Cody's full story, you can do that here.\n\n3. One burning question for every team in the NFC East\n\nWith all the roster changes that have happened around the league this offseason, there are plenty of questions that each team will need to answer before we know if they'll actually be good in 2024.\n\nWith that in mind, we've been going through each division to look at the biggest question for each team heading into the upcoming season. Today, we're going to cover the NFC East.\n\nHere's one burning question that Jeff Kerr has come up with for each team.\n\nCowboys: Is this Dak Prescott's final season in Dallas? \"With Prescott's contract expiring after the 2024 season, Dallas will essentially have two options going forward: Let him walk after the season, making the 2024 season \"Super Bowl or bust\" while not having an answer at quarterback for 2025 and beyond or make Prescott the highest-paid quarterback in the NFL and be tied to him for several more seasons with an average annual salary of over $55 million a year.\"\n\n\"With Prescott's contract expiring after the 2024 season, Dallas will essentially have two options going forward: Let him walk after the season, making the 2024 season \"Super Bowl or bust\" while not having an answer at quarterback for 2025 and beyond or make Prescott the highest-paid quarterback in the NFL and be tied to him for several more seasons with an average annual salary of over $55 million a year.\" Eagles: Will James Bradberry be on the team by start of training camp? \"The Eagles invested heavily in the cornerback position during the draft, drafting Quinyon Mitchell in the first round (No. 22 overall) and Cooper DeJean in the second (No. 40). ... If Bradberry isn't starting, there's no sense for the Eagles to have him on the roster with their cornerback group.\"\n\n\"The Eagles invested heavily in the cornerback position during the draft, drafting Quinyon Mitchell in the first round (No. 22 overall) and Cooper DeJean in the second (No. 40). ... If Bradberry isn't starting, there's no sense for the Eagles to have him on the roster with their cornerback group.\" Giants: Are there enough pass-catching weapons for Daniel Jones to succeed? \"On paper, this pass-catching group may be the best Jones has had. Will it be enough for Jones to throw more than 20 touchdown passes in a season and have a passer rating over 95.0? Even if Jones gets those numbers, is that enough to keep his job if the Giants don't win more than eight games? How Jones progresses with these playmakers will be the key toward his future with the organization.\"\n\n\"On paper, this pass-catching group may be the best Jones has had.

The Commanders are better with Daniels at quarterback. If Daniels can avoid the turnovers, the Commanders' rebuild may go significantly quicker than expected.\"\n\nTo read Kerr's full answer for each question, be sure to click here.\n\n4. Lower-round NFC rookies who could shine in 2024\n\nUSATSI\n\nIf there's one thing that happens in the NFL every year, it's that we see a rookie have a huge year after slipping through the cracks in the NFL Draft. Although first-round picks generally get all the hype, the ability to find successful players after Day 1 is what separates the good teams from the great teams.\n\nLast year, we saw an example of that with Puka Nacua, who set the NFL rookie records for most receptions (105) and most receiving yards (1,486) after being taken in the fifth round by the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nWith that in mind, CBS Sports draft guru Chris Trapasso went through each NFC team's roster to find one rookie -- who was taken after the first round -- who could have some major success this year. Here's a look at a few of the rookies who made the cut on Trapasso's list.\n\nEagles DE Cooper DeJean (second round, 40th overall pick). \"No one, probably not even Nick Sirianni, knows exactly where DeJean is going to play, and that is a wonderful thing in today's NFL. He'll be a slot corner, free safety, strong safety, linebacker and outside cornerback in a Philadelphia defense, that, yeah, needs all of those things after an at times disastrous showing from that side of the ball, particularly in the back seven.\"\n\n\"No one, probably not even Nick Sirianni, knows exactly where DeJean is going to play, and that is a wonderful thing in today's NFL.

He's an anomaly. Under 5-foot-9 but 220 pounds with under 4.50 speed (he ran 4.46 at the combine). ... Yes, the Packers made a decision to swap out Aaron Jones for Josh Jacobs this offseason, but you better believe Lloyd will get touches in Year 1. And he'll make the most of them.\"\n\n\"You don't see many backs like Lloyd. He's an anomaly. Under 5-foot-9 but 220 pounds with under 4.50 speed (he ran 4.46 at the combine). ...

James (sixth round, 192nd overall pick). \"Seattle has so much fun, young, dynamic talent in the secondary. But James is an overachiever likely to make enough of a name for himself this summer that new head coach Mike Macdonald -- who certainly loves to rotate in the defensive backfield -- will have to give him playing time in Year 1.\"\n\nIf you want to see the full list of every rookie who made Trapasso's list, then be sure to click here.\n\n5. Peyton Manning is still making more than almost every other NFL player in licensing royalties\n\nUSATSI\n\nPeyton Manning hasn't played in the NFL in nearly 10 years, but he's still making more money than almost every other player when it comes to royalties.\n\nThe NFLPA sends a royalty check to players every year, and for the period that covered the 2023 season (March 1, 2023 through Feb. 29, 2024), Manning pulled in a total of $2.09 million, which was the seventh-highest number in the NFL. At this point, Manning could probably just live off of his royalties if he wanted to.\n\nHere's a look at the top-10 earners (via Cllct.com)\n\n1. Patrick Mahomes: $3.63 million\n\n2. Jalen Hurts: $2.69 million\n\n3. Josh Allen: $2.55 million\n\n4. Travis Kelce: $2.43 million\n\n5. Trevor Lawrence: $2.35 million\n\n6. Micah Parsons: $2.18 million\n\n7. Peyton Manning: $2.09 million\n\n8. Dak Prescott: $2.03 million\n\n9. Joe Burrow: $1.90 million\n\n10. Rob Gronkowski: $1.89 million\n\nManning was one of two retired players, along with Gronk, who cracked the top 10. After that, there were no other retired players who were even in the top 20.\n\nThe royalty numbers come from the NFL Players Association and they only take into account endorsements that the NFLPA licenses, such as jerseys, video games, and trading cards (Mahomes made millions more doing endorsements for companies like Coors Light, Subway and State Farm, but those aren't included in the total since those companies don't sell NFLPA licensed merchandise).\n\n6. Extra points: Panthers propose $800 million stadium deal\n\nIt's been a busy 24 hours in the NFL, and since it's nearly impossible to keep track of everything that happened, I went ahead and put together a roundup for you.",

      "title": "2024 U.S. Open odds, predictions, golf picks: Scottie Scheffler projection by model that nailed last 2 majors",
      "news": "Scottie Scheffler has nearly as many victories as finishes outside the top 10 over his 10 majors since 2022. Scheffler won his second major by claiming the 2024 Masters and followed by finishing T-8 in the PGA Championship. Now, the U.S. Open 2024 begins on Thursday, June 13 from Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina and Scheffler is the 4-1 favorite in the 2024 U.S. Open odds. Rory McIlroy (9-1) and Xander Schauffele (10-1) follow in the 2024 U.S. Open field.\n\nScheffler leads the PGA Tour in categories such as total strokes gained, putting average, scoring average and birdie average, so should you include him in your 2024 U.S. Opens prediction despite being a heavy favorite over the rest of the 2024 U.S. Open golfers? Before locking in your 2024 U.S. Open picks or Scottie Scheffler props, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nOur proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June of 2020. In fact, the model is up almost $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nMcClure's model correctly predicted Scottie Scheffler would finish on top of the leaderboard at the 2024 Masters, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and The Players Championship this season. McClure also included Hideki Matsuyama in his best bets to win the 2024 Genesis Invitational. That bet hit at +9000, and for the entire tournament, McClure's best bets returned nearly $1,000.\n\nThe model also predicted Jon Rahm would be victorious at the 2023 Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express. At the 2023 Masters, the model was all over Rahm's second career major victory heading into the weekend. Rahm was two strokes off the lead heading into the third round, but the model still projected him as the winner. It was the second straight Masters win for the model, which also nailed Scheffler winning in 2022.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 12 majors entering the weekend, including three straight Masters and the 2024 PGA Championship. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the U.S. Open 2024 field taking shape, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 U.S. Open predictions\n\nOne major surprise: Bryson DeChambeau, a 20-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. DeChambeau finished second at the PGA Championship after placing T-6 at the Masters in 2024 major events. The 30-year-old has finished sixth or better in three of his last five majors.\n\nDeChambeau, who won the 2021 U.S. Open, shot below a 69 in all four rounds of the 2024 PGA Championship, including a 64 on Sunday. He also had a strong start to the Masters with a 65 in his first round. DeChambeau has three rounds of 65 or lower over his last eight major rounds and if he continues that play, he can exit the 2024 U.S. Open as the 23rd two-time U.S. Open winner in tournament history. DeChambeau was second in total strokes gained, including third strokes gained: tee-to-green, and was one of four golfers with four eagles while finishing T-3 in scoring average on Par 3 holes at the 2024 PGA Championship. The model projects that success to continue at the U.S. Open 2024.\n\nThe model has also examined where Scottie Scheffler finishes. The 27-year-old has spent 89 weeks of his career at No. 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking and has managed to hold onto that title for 55 weeks in a row. Already considered one of the world's best ball-strikers, he's improved on the greens in 2024 and is putting together the best season of his career.\n\nScheffler has won four times this year and is a 10-time PGA Tour winner overall. That includes a victory at the 2024 Masters that came during a stellar stretch in which he had four wins and a runner-up finish over a span of five starts. However, while he's consistently near the top of the leaderboard in major championships, he still hasn't been able to break through for a victory in a grand slam event outside of Augusta National Golf Club. The model just locked in its Scottie Scheffler U.S. Open picks here..\n\nHow to make 2024 U.S. Open picks\n\nThe model is also targeting two other golfers with odds of 20-1 or longer to make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2024 U.S. Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

      "title": "NASCAR Power Rankings: Austin Cindric's Gateway win leads rise for all of Team Penske",
      "news": "1 Denny Hamlin -- Dating back to his win at Dover, Denny Hamlin has been on a stretch of five top-10 finishes in a row. Of the eight top-10 finishes he's had during the 2024 season, seven of them have been top fives as well.\n\n\n\n2 Brad Keselowski -- RFK Racing had finished first or second in five of six races entering Gateway, but that streak is now five of seven after neither of their cars finished in the top two. Granted, Brad Keselowski wasn't that far off as he finished third.\n\n\n\n3 Tyler Reddick Tyler Reddick's second-straight fourth-place finish gave him his sixth top five on the season, putting him more than halfway toward breaking his career-high mark. Reddick has had 10 top-five finishes in each of the past two seasons.\n\n\n\n4 Chase Elliott When the Next Gen car was first introduced in 2022, an early issue that popped up was how easy it was to break a toe link if a car bounced off the wall. It speaks to how nicely the development of the car has come along that Chase Elliott knocked the toe out after getting into the wall on a restart, but still ran in the top 10 and eventually finished 13th.\n\n\n\n5 Christopher Bell NASCAR engines these days are so well-developed and well-engineered that it's very rare to see one of them fail, much less break outright, in the closing laps. We'll see what the problem with Christopher Bell ended up being, but the early theory seems to be that the amount of shifting and transmission work Bell was doing had some sort of ill effect.\n\n\n\n6 Ross Chastain Ross Chastain will be a driver worthy of watching at Sonoma. Not only did his first career win come on a road course at COTA in 2022, but he was also one of the drivers that tested at the newly-repaved Sonoma in March.\n\n\n\n7 Ty Gibbs On the subject of contenders at Sonoma, you should absolutely include Ty Gibbs in that category. His road racing abilities shone through at COTA, where he qualified on the outside pole and eventually ran third.\n\n\n\n8 Chris Buescher Austin Cindric's Gateway win puts pressure on drivers around the playoff cut line to get to Victory Lane, as Cindric went from not really being in the picture to now on the playoff grid. Those two near misses Chris Buescher had at Kansas and Darlington now surely sting way more.\n\n\n\n9 William Byron -- I wish Valvoline paint schemes in this day and age didn't change so frequently, as I feel like the one William Byron ran at Gateway would have looked great for a full season on Mark Martin's car way back when. Byron ran 15th with the sponsor Martin had for so many years in the 1990s.\n\n\n\n10 Kyle Larson We'll see what the official reason is for why Kyle Larson was not credited with any playoff points following Gateway, but the longer the matter of his playoff waiver drags on, the more people have wondered exactly why. Larson offered a theory of his own on FS1's pre-race show, suggesting NASCAR actually may have to re-write the waiver rule if they elect to grant him a waiver for his circumstances.\n\n\n\n11 Joey Logano An after-effect of Austin Cindric's win on the playoff cut line: Joey Logano is now two spots below the cut line, some 14 points back of Chris Buescher for the current last available spot on points.\n\n\n\n12 Austin Cindric Isn't there something that feels so right about the No. 2 car going to Victory Lane in Rusty Wallace's hometown? Wallace, the longtime pilot of the car Cindric now calls his own, is a native of the St. Louis area.\n\n\n\n13 Ryan Blaney On the subject of the cut line, about a lap and a couple of drops of fuel separated Ryan Blaney from virtually certain to defend his Cup championship to still having to get away from the bubble. He's currently 12th in points, just 37 points clear of Chris Buescher.\n\n\n\n14 Bubba Wallace Bubba Wallace was unable to sustain his speed from qualifying, fading from the eighth starting spot to 21st at the checkered flag. That marks Wallace's worst finish in any race he's been running at the end of since he ran 29th at Bristol in March.\n\n\n\n15 Michael McDowell Michael McDowell led 40 laps from the pole at Gateway after setting a new track record in qualifying. He's got a chance at Sonoma to lead just as many if not more, as road courses are among McDowell's greatest opportunities to get a win and make the playoffs for the third time in the last four seasons.\n\n\n\n16 Martin Truex Jr. Martin Truex Jr. represented Toyota at the Sonoma tire test in March, and the rest of the field probably wishes he hadn't. Truex has four career Sonoma wins, three of which have come in the track's last five races dating back to 2018.\n\n\n\n17 Todd Gilliland Todd Gilliland stands to become the team leader on what will be a three-car team at Front Row Motorsports next year. His dad, David Gilliland, was part of FRM's previous attempts at three full-time cars, namely after they rapidly expanded following a move to Ford in 2010.\n\n\n\n18 Josh Berry As he now looks for a ride for next season, Josh Berry will be tasked in June with distinguishing himself in SHR equipment while also keeping close to his roots as a short track racer. Before the Cup race weekend at Nashville Superspeedway, Berry will drive a late model for Dylan Fetcho in the Battle of Broadway 150 at Nashville Fairgrounds.\n\n\n\n19 Justin Haley Justin Haley has a multi-year contract to drive for Rick Ware Racing. But if he keeps delivering top-10 finishes like he did at Gateway, Haley is going to be in demand with larger teams as Stewart-Haas Racing's charters get divvied out. Something for both RWR and Ford to consider.\n\n\n\n20 Carson Hocevar Carson Hocevar has enjoyed a strange history at Gateway. He broke his ankle in a crash there during a Truck Series race in 2022, made his Cup debut there in 2023, and WWT Raceway is now the site of Hocevar's best career finish in a Cup car.\n\n\n\n21 Chase Briscoe As the first driver below the playoff cut line, a trip to Sonoma doesn't really help Chase Briscoe. He's never finished better than 13th there in three Cup starts and ran 29th last year.\n\n\n\n22 Alex Bowman Alex Bowman had an uncharacteristically poor run at Gateway, as brake issues plagued the No. 48 Chevrolet. Bowman's 28th-place finish was his worst in any race this season where he's been running at the finish.\n\n\n\n23 Noah Gragson To find the last time Noah Gragson raced at Sonoma, you have to go all the way back to when he was racing in what is now the ARCA Menards Series West. Gragson has three West Series starts at Sonoma, winning there in 2019.\n\n\n\n24 Kyle Busch After his crash at Gateway, Kyle Busch now finds himself beneath the playoff cut line and looking to get in. Busch hasn't missed the postseason since 2012 and has never missed the playoffs since the current format was introduced in 2014.\n\n\n\n25 Daniel Suarez With two laps to go at Gateway, it seemed very odd as to why Daniel Suarez passed leader Ryan Blaney to get back on the lead lap as Blaney was trying to hang on for the victory. About a hundred yards later, as Blaney ran out of fuel, everything seemed to make sense at once.\n\n\n\n26 Ricky Stenhouse Jr. -- In more than a decade at the Cup Series level, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. has never had a single top-10 finish at Sonoma. In fact, a 12th-place finish there a year ago actually marked the first top 15 he'd ever scored there.\n\n\n\n27 Daniel Hemric Credit to Daniel Hemric and his team for the way they persevered at Gateway. Hemric was running dead last early in the race, but wound up working his way up through the field to 18th by race's end.\n\n\n\n28 Erik Jones Legacy Motor Club's move to Toyota still has yet to pay dividends for the team in terms of consistent performance. Their two cars finished right together toward the back of the pack with Erik Jones in 26th and John Hunter Nemechek in 27th.\n\n\n\n29 Corey LaJoie Despite being the designated team leader at Spire Motorsports, Corey LaJoie has taken a backseat to his younger teammates as the season has gone on. LaJoie finished 32nd at Gateway, well behind both of his teammates Carson Hocevar and Zane Smith.\n\n",

      "title": "Texans' Tank Dell says shooting injury resulted from a 'wrong place, wrong time' situation",
      "news": "Earlier this offseason, Houston Texans wide receiver Tank Dell sustained a minor injury to his leg during a shooting incident in Sanford, Florida. Dell was an innocent bystander in the incident, which saw a 16-year-old arrested after shooting 10 people.\n\nTexans owner Cal McNair said shortly after the shooting that Dell would make a full recovery, and within a few weeks, Dell was already back to working out and running routes, looking a lot like the player he did during his breakout rookie season. Now, Dell has spoken about the incident itself.\n\n\"First off, I'm blessed,\" Dell said during an appearance on teammate C.J. Stroud's 'Million Dollaz Worth of Game' podcast. \"To me, it was just wrong place, wrong time. I went back to see my mom. I wasn't even planning to go back and go to the little pool party or whatever, but my boys found out I was home, so they hit me up.\n\n\"They was like, 'Pull up to the party.' They told me there was going to be security, people getting checked at the door, stuff like that, so I'm like, all right, cool. It's a good vibe, and there were a lot of people that I knew in there, so it was cool. Then that (expletive) just popped off out of nowhere. It just went south out of nowhere.\"\n\nAt the time of the shooting, the Seminole County Sheriff's Office said that the incident began as a verbal altercation and escalated from there, and that the shooter was apprehended by a security officer working at the venue, while the victims, including Dell, suffered non-life-threatening injuries. The bullet that hit Dell went cleanly through his leg and out the other side.\n\n\"I thought I removed myself from the situation, like when you see on the video when I ran across,\" Dell said. \"But I put myself in the middle of two people. It just went crazy.\"\n\nStroud, meanwhile, said that the incident made him think about the things he does when he goes back home during the offseason.\n\n\"It was a good moment for me to realize, like, I can't go home and do the same things I was doing, too,\" Stroud said. \"'Cause sometimes when I go home, that's where I'm comfortable at -- going to the pool parties, going to the bowling alleys or, like, the skating rinks or to the house parties. This is the people I grew up with. I ain't changed. Just because I got a little bit of money. For that moment to happen that quick, it was an eye-opening experience.\"",

      "news": "United Football League UFL 2024: Every touchdown from Week 10 Published Jun. 4, 2024 12:56 p.m. ET share facebook x reddit link\n\nWeek 10 of the UFL season featured four tightly-contested, one-score affairs \u2014 which included two entertaining games from teams out of playoff contention.\n\nHere's every touchdown from Week 10!\n\nEvery Touchdown of Week 10\n\nMichigan Panthers vs. Birmingham Stallions\n\nThe Birmingham Stallions were in trouble early, as the Michigan Panthers trailed by 10 at halftime, but the former prevailed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBirmingham opened the second half with a five-play touchdown drive, capped off by a 20-yard rushing score from running back CJ Marable \u2014 who finished the game with two touchdowns. Then, in the closing moments, the Stallions put together a 12-play touchdown drive, with quarterback Adrian Martinez and tight end Jace Sternberger hooking up for a 5-yard score. The Stallions then converted a go-ahead, one-point conversion to ultimately win, 20-19.\n\nSan Antonio Brahmas vs. St. Louis Battlehawks\n\nThis was a messy game, but one that saw the St. Louis Battlehawks hold on to beat the San Antonio Brahmas, 13-12.\n\nThe Battlehawks' lone touchdown came when AJ McCarron hit wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. for a 22-yard score. That said, the Brahmas made a late push but had a go-ahead, two-point conversion called back due to an ineligible downfield pass. San Antonio had another chance to take the lead when it forced a three-and-out and got past midfield on its next possession, but kicker Ryan Santoso missed a 51-yard field goal with eight seconds remaining in the game.\n\nArlington Renegades vs. DC Defenders\n\nThe Arlington Renegades and the DC Defenders put together a high-scoring bout that saw Arlington come out on top, 32-31.\n\nRenegades quarterback Luis Perez threw for three touchdowns, with wide receiver Tyler Vaughns coming down with two of them \u2014 one being a 34-yard score. For the Defenders, wide receivers Vyncint Smith and Brandon Smith had 43- and 40- yard touchdown passes off the arm of quarterback Jordan Ta'amu. All in all, there were nine lead changes.\n\nHouston Roughnecks vs. Memphis Showboats\n\nIt was a game of field goals in the first half, but the Memphis Showboats offense came to life in the second half, enough to get them a 19-12 win over the Houston Roughnecks .\n\nMemphis put together 70- and 53-yard touchdown drives with running back Darius Victor finishing off both drives with a 2-yard score. For Houston, running back Kirk Merritt punched in a goal-line touchdown on the ground, while also reeling in five receptions for a game-high 75 yards.\n\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

      "title": "Snyder's Soapbox: Five suggestions for MLB umpires before ejecting players, from gongs to automatic strikes",
      "news": "Welcome to Snyder's Soapbox! Here I pontificate about a matter related to Major League Baseball on a weekly basis. Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is it's free and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though, that's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.\n\nDid everyone see the Bryce Harper ejection at Coors Field just over a week ago?\n\nObviously, we can't hear everything that was said there, but it sure seems like the umpire had an itchy trigger finger.\n\nPart of me imagines a kid in the Denver area dreaming of seeing Bryce Harper in person someday. The kid's parents save up and surprise the child with tickets. The excitement builds. Finally, I get to see Bryce Harper!\n\nAnd he's tossed in the middle of the first inning.\n\nThere's always the realistic chance something like this happens. I'm not saying the umpires should never eject anyone, because a lot of times they deserve it. And maybe Bryce did deserve this one. Again, we have no idea what was said. Harper certainly looked shocked when the ejection happened, though, so I'm guessing he wasn't saying anything too bad, at least in his mind.\n\nThe root of the problem here, though, isn't the umpires themselves. Yeah, they are part of it and sometimes could stand to take a bit more flack without needing to flex their muscles with a theatrical ejection. The biggest issue for me is they don't have any other recourse when a player, manager or coach is going off on them. That's why you see them yelling back sometimes, which feels unique to baseball.\n\nIn football, there's an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. In basketball, there's a technical foul. In soccer, there's a yellow card. In hockey, there's misconduct.\n\nIn baseball, it's all or nothing. No blood whatsoever or an ejection.\n\nShouldn't there be a middle ground to serve as a bit of a warning while also slightly punishing the offender without going straight to the ejection?\n\nI must warn you before diving in that this won't be for everyone. There are some serious suggestions and some not-so-serious. If you get worked up easily, you probably should find a straight news article somewhere else on our fine site.\n\nPlease enjoy, but also keep in mind I'm dead serious about there needing to be some sort of recourse for the umpires between just taking it and ejecting someone.\n\nAn arguing violation\n\nIt's very simple, right? When someone goes over the line for the first time in a game, there's no need to go straight to the showers. How about just a violation. A second gets the person ejected. The umpires need a way to signal that a violation has been committed and I'm partial to tossing their hat.\n\nThink about the added drama and, yes, humor to the situation. A manager is going off on the home plate umpire and the ump then rips off his mask and theatrically throws his hat into the air.\n\nBeautiful.\n\nI'm open to this also being a flag, a colored card or a hand signal (like the \"T\" in hoops). My insane colleague Dayn Perry suggested one umpire rushing behind home plate to bang a giant gong and now I can't stop laughing thinking about this. We're always open to ideas here at the Soapbox.\n\nMoving forward, keep in mind with any of these punishments that we'll also have a \"two means an ejection\" clause tacked on.\n\nThe Penalty Box\n\nHey, we'll draw from hockey here. If a player commits his first violation, he needs to visit the penalty box for the next inning. That means if his spot in the batting order comes up, not only is it skipped but it's an automatic out. When the team of the violator is in the field, they'll be playing down a man.\n\nThis would actually be a substantial penalty, right? Major deterrence?\n\nAutomatic balls/strikes\n\nThis is a bit less steep. Once there's a violation, it's an automatic strike (if the violating team is at bat) or ball (if the violating team is on defense).\n\nWe could also move to automatic outs on the offense or taking outs away from the defense? Maybe that's too strict. I don't know. We're just spitballing here!\n\nThe Dunce Punishment\n\nIf it's a position player, he'll be required to wear a dunce helmet for the entirety of his next at-bat. If it's a pitcher, he's required to wear a dunce cap for the next batter he faces.\n\nThe Moving Fence\n\nThis was the bright idea of my father, so come forth with your \"apple doesn't fall far from the tree\" comments. There would be a set distance for a violation. We'll call it 25 feet.\n\nIf the violator is on defense, the outfield wall moves in 25 feet for the remainder of the inning. If the violator is on offense, the outfield wall moves back 25 feet for the next inning.\n\nThe Heavy Bat\n\nIf the violator is an offensive player, he'll be required to use an extra-heavy bat next time he digs in. We're talking at least double, so something in the 70-80 ounce range. If the violator is a defensive player, it'll just be the next batter from that team. Peer pressure is a good deterrent.\n\nSeriously, though, I'm still laughing about the gong. Just picturing a random umpire sprinting in from second base to bang a gong while a player is losing his mind is off-the-charts funny.",

      "title": "Mississippi State University Extension Service",
      "news": "STARKVILLE, Miss. -- The 4-H Shooting Sports program in Mississippi recently hosted district competitions and will hold its state championship in July, but Reid Nevins is quick to point out the project\u2019s true mission.\n\n\u201cThis is a youth development project and not a competitive shooting project,\u201d said Nevins, 4-H environmental science and education specialist with the Mississippi State University Extension Service. \u201cWe have plenty of kids in this program that never sign up for a contest and just come to the shooting practices.\u201d\n\nIn Mississippi, the program currently boasts around 3,500 participants from the ages of 8 to 18 across nine disciplines, but Nevins wants to keep it growing.\n\n\u201cOne of my goals is to steadily build on that number,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that means we will also need more volunteer instructors to help our agents get certified to deliver the program safely and effectively.\u201d\n\nEllen Russell, MSU Extension agent in Covington County and coordinator of shooting sports for the Southeast district, has seen firsthand what the program can do for young people of all backgrounds. Marion County 4-H Shooting Sports member Colsten Belk, who has special needs, competed at the Southeast District Shoot for the first time earlier this year.\n\nRussell said Belk\u2019s mother met with Amanda Woods, MSU Extension agent in Marion County, to discuss his ability to compete. Russell and Woods worked to make accommodations to allow for his participation.\n\n\u201cColsten was born with cerebral palsy, which affects his motor skills on his left side,\u201d Russell said. \u201cHe is an avid hunter and loves the outdoors and shooting, but his family was concerned that his physical limitations would limit his participation in our program, but we made it happen.\n\n\u201cHe felt a sense of accomplishment, belonging and acceptance he has never felt before, thanks to 4-H,\u201d she added. \u201cHe loves being able to just be a kid and shoot bullseyes. It makes him proud to see how well he can do.\u201d\n\nBeau Varner, MSU Extension agent based in Attala County, said the safe environment the program offers fosters teamwork, leadership and respect for firearms while promoting outdoor recreation.\n\n\u201cI have seen youth participate in Shooting Sports that were not able to show proper technique when holding a firearm or hit the target multiple times when first starting to practice,\u201d Varner said. \u201cAfter practicing consistently, they become more confident and improve their skills in both technique and hitting targets.\u201d\n\nBringing history to life\n\nMississippi\u2019s 4-H Shooting Sports program has nine disciplines, including .22 pistol, air rifle, archery, muzzleloading and shotgun, among others. The newest one, and the one getting the most buzz, is \u201cWestern Heritage.\u201d What sets it apart from the other categories is its period specific attire and format.\n\n\u201cThe Western Heritage discipline brings history to life for our 4-H members,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIt is a living history depiction of the West from 1860 to 1900 using historically accurate firearms, clothing, and accessories. Participants dress in historically accurate attire from this era for the three-part contest.\u201d\n\nThe first part features a public speaking component. Contestants take on a historically accurate persona and undergo an interview, answering questions about their persona\u2019s attire, living accommodations, daily activities and firearms. The second phase is a test with period-specific questions about notable historical figures, locations and firearms. The contest concludes with a live-fire, timed competition.\n\n\u201c4-H members shoot period specific firearms such as rifles, pistols and shotguns at steel targets,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIn true western fashion, the fastest time wins.\u201d\n\nNevins said the category originated more than 10 years ago in Montana\u2019s 4-H Shooting Sports program.\n\n\u201cWhat I like about it is there\u2019s a lot more to it than our standard shooting disciplines,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are developing a lot more than just your aim and knowledge of the firearm and how to use it safely. You\u2019re learning history and building social skills that will help in adulthood.\u201d\n\nSafety first\n\nTwo of the program\u2019s foremost objectives are to teach the safe and responsible use of firearms and archery equipment, and to promote the highest standards of safety and sportsmanship.\n\nEach of the program\u2019s volunteer leaders is trained by Level II state instructors with national certification. Adult volunteers receive training in shooting sports at state and regional workshops to become qualified instructors.\n\n\u201cOur instructors are more than just volunteer leaders,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThey are technical experts in their discipline and dedicated mentors and role models for 4-H Shooting Sports youth.\u201d\n\nVarner added that volunteers are more than just coaches.\n\n\u201cThey provide guidance, expertise and mentorship to 4-H\u2019ers, helping them develop proper shooting techniques, sportsmanship and respect for firearms,\u201d said Varner, who also leads the Shooting Sports program for Mississippi\u2019s Southwest district. \u201cTrained adult volunteers ensure safety measures are followed, creating a secure environment for youth participants to learn and practice shooting sports. They engage with community members and recruit participants to support involvement in the program.\u201d\n\nOne of these leaders is Alvis McCray, who works with 4-H\u2019ers in Covington County. The program is a family affair for him and his wife, Jessica, who has the same certification and works with air rifle participants, and his three children, each of whom compete in multiple disciplines.\n\nMcCray said spring practice season for events means lots of range time for his family and he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, but he enjoys being able to share his knowledge as a certified shotgun instructor with all the 4-H\u2019ers he teaches.\n\n\u201cYou can learn a lot from them,\u201d McCray said, \u201cif you just listen.\u201d\n\nGetting involved\n\nVarner noted the need of adult volunteers not just for 4-H Shooting Sports, but for any 4-H program.\n\n\u201cThese programs would not succeed without volunteers,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all the disciplines in the shooting sports program, agents would not have enough time to provide adequate training and practice time for the events.\u201d\n\nRussell added that volunteers are needed to help recruit members, coordinate county programs, organize district events and help manage state events.\n\n\u201cFall is normally the best time of the year to sign kids up because most of our shooting sports programs kick off in the late fall or early winter each year,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone who is age eligible and interested in joining 4-H for shooting sports should stop by their local Extension office and sign up for 4-H so they can get all the updates and start times for shooting sports in their local area.\u201d\n\nMore information on the 4-H Shooting Sports program in Mississippi is available online at http://extension.msstate.edu/4-h/4-h-safety-programs/4-h-shooting-sports.",

      "news": "Florida A&M has lost one of its most devoted and passionate Rattlers.\n\nEddie Jackson, President of the 220 Quarterback Club, passed away in his sleep Monday afternoon, his wife Jerrlyne announced through the organization in an email Monday night.\n\nJackson was 86 years old.\n\n\u201cIt is with tears in my eyes and a hole in my heart that I share with you that \u2018our Eddie\u2019 has left us,\u201d Jerrlyne said in the email to club members.\n\n\u201cShortly after 2:00 p.m. (Monday), he quietly stopped breathing while sleeping and took flight to join his Savior, some family, and other Rattlers in that \u201cprepared peaceful place.\u201d\n\nA FAMU graduate, Jackson spent his professional career as the Rattlers\u2019 athletic department\u2019s sports information director, University Relations\u2019 communications director, and vice president.\n\nLater, in 2009, Jackson started the 220 Quarterback Club, which began as a fundraising group to support FAMU\u2019s football program.\n\nThe 220 Quarterback Club, which has weekly luncheons on Wednesdays, then expanded to all FAMU sports and assisted with university needs.\n\nPresided by Jackson, the 220 Quarterback Club made donations to the Rattler football program to get a nutrition station, gifted televisions to the Galimore-Powell Fieldhouse, and also made the program the first HBCU to get a cooling station to combat warm temperatures during preseason training camp.\n\nJackson\u2019s death came amidst an ambitious $1 million fundraising push to FAMU Athletics by the year\u2019s end. The goal always seemed possible to Jackson.\n\n\u201cRight now, it seems it may be a bridge too far for some people,\u201d he told the club in April. \u201cBut, we are Rattler Strong. We are Rattler Strong. We don\u2019t shrink from a great challenge.\u201d\n\nJackson was inducted into the FAMU Sports Hall of Fame in 2008 as a contributor, supporter, and administrator for his commitment to the university\u2019s progression.\n\nIn 2009, Jackson, who worked directly with and befriended legendary Rattlers football coach Jake Gaither, authored the book \u2018Coaching Against the Wind,\u2019 chronicling FAMU football\u2019s national championship seasons.\n\nHe also penned columns for the Tallahassee Democrat about FAMU history and how the school overcame adversity, noting that \u201cwhen dark clouds gather on the horizon, FAMU comes first.\u201d\n\n\u201cChallenges come with the territory, but Florida A&M University is now in a place it has never been before,\u201d he wrote in 2022. \u201cFAMU now stands on solid as well as sacred ground. It is a fully-fledged member of the State University System of Florida, its identity intact, growing stronger every day, and you have been there every step along the way.\u201d\n\nFuneral and memorial arrangements for Jackson have not been set yet. Jackson\u2019s family will release details once they become available.\n\nGerald Thomas, III covers Florida A&M University Athletics for the Tallahassee Democrat.

      "news": "Newcastle United have announced JD Sports as the club\u2019s new official sports retail partner.\n\nThe agreement means the retailer \u2014 which has more than 1,200 stores across 24 countries worldwide \u2014 will stock Newcastle\u2019s 2024-25 home, away and third kits, which will be manufactured by German sportswear giant Adidas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April, JD\u2019s rival retailer Sports Direct attempted to secure an injunction at tribunal to prevent the deal, which it claims breaches competition laws.\n\nSports Direct, which is run by former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, were also seeking \u00a31.5million ($1.9m) in damages.\n\nAshley sold the club for \u00a3305m ($386m) to the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund in 2021 after a 14 year-spell in charge that was punctuated by fan protests over a perceived lack of investment.\n\nLawyers for Sports Direct said preventing the \u201cretailer that offered the lowest prices\u201d from selling next season\u2019s club kits would harm consumers.\n\nGO DEEPER Along came Mike Ashley\n\nThomas de la Mare KC, representing Newcastle, said the deal was a \u201ctripartite\u201d arrangement \u2014 commonplace practice in the market \u2014 between the club, manufacturer Adidas and JD Sports, which would not contravene laws on fair competition.\n\nThe Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) dismissed Sports Direct\u2019s case on April 12.

      "title": "Shohei Ohtani's ex-interpreter pleads guilty in $17M sports gambling scandal",
      "news": "What to Know Ippei Mizuhara, 39, agreed to plea guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return as part of a deal with prosecutors.\n\nThe former interpreter for Shohei Ohtani could face up to 30 years in federal prison under the plea deal.\n\nThe investigation into Mizuhara's sports betting was part of a larger probe involving illegal gambling operations.\n\nShohei Ohtani's former interpreter pleaded guilty Tuesday to bank and tax fraud in a sport betting scandal in which he is accused of stealing nearly $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers star over several years.\n\nIppei Mizuhara appeared Tuesday morning in federal court in Orange County for the change-of-plea hearing. The hearing comes about a month after prosecutors and Mizuhara, a longtime friend of Ohtani's, reached a plea agreement as part of a broader federal sports gambling investigation.\n\nGet Southern California news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC LA newsletters.\n\nThe 39-year-old Newport Beach resident pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return. During the hearing, Mizuhara said he fell into major gambling debt. The only way out, he said, was to use money wired from Ohtani's account.\n\nThe bank fraud charge has a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison. Mizuhara faces a maximum sentence of up to three years in federal prison for the false tax return charge.\n\nSentencing was scheduled for Oct. 25.\n\n\"The interpreter is going to get a huge break, assuming he comes through with cooperation with the feds,\" said NBCLA legal analyst Royal Oakes. \"This guy is not a big fish, but he's going to flip if he helps the prosecution. That means, they're going to reward him with a very light sentence.\"\n\nProsecutors accused Mizuhara of placing a staggering number of bets using money stolen from a longtime friend and one of the world's most popular and well-paid athletes to support a \"voracious appetite\" for sports betting. The allegations against the Orange County man were outlined in a lengthy criminal complaint in support of federal bank fraud charge.\n\nA day after the federal charges were announced in April, Mizuhara apologized to Ohtani in a statement made through his attorney that indicated a deal was likely. Attorney Michael G. Freedman issued the statement, saying Mizuhara hopes to \u201creach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility.\u201d He further added Mizuhara \u201cwishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family.\u201d\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint filed in the gambling scandal, Mizuhara placed about 19,000 wagers between December 2021 and January 2024 with nearly 25 bets per day on average. The wagers ranged in value from roughly $10 to $160,000 per bet, with an average bet amount of roughly $12,800.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled more than $142,256,000 and losing bets about $182,935,000. Total losses amounted to more than $40,679,000, the affidavit said.\n\nThe complaint, written by an IRS senior special agent, cites wire transfers, text messages, phone records and interviews. In a text message to a bookmaker, Mizuhara admitted that he was stealing the money from Ohtani's account, prosecutors said. The investigation into Mizuhara was part of a larger probe involving illegal gambling operations.\n\nAuthorities announced federal charges against Ippei Mizuhara who allegedly helped set up a bank account for Shohei Ohtani in 2018. NBC Los Angeles\u2019 Karma Dickerson reports.\n\nProsecutors have said there is no evidence Ohtani authorized the transfers from his account and characterized the baseball superstar as a victim in the case. Ohtani reportedly has been assisting authorities with the investigation.\n\nThe records do not indicate any bets on baseball.\n\nThe hearing comes on the same day San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano received a lifetime ban from MLB for betting on baseball.\n\nLeague Rule 21 states that players and team employees are prohibited from placing wagers, even legal bets, on baseball and from wagering with illegal or offshore bookmakers. It also mentions the possible punishments, which may be largely left up to the league's front office.\n\nThe scandal broke in mid-March after Mizuhara was fired for an alleged theft from Ohtani's bank accounts to cover illegal gambling losses. Those gambling debts were to an illegal bookmaker in Orange County who was under IRS investigation.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Mizuhara accompanied Ohtani to a bank branch in Arizona when they opened the account in 2018, with Mizuhara translating for Ohtani to set up the account. Ohtani\u2019s salary was deposited into the account, prosecutors said, and he never gave Mizuhara control of the account or any of his other financial accounts, according to the affidavit.\n\nInvestigators believe Ohtani's earnings from endorsement deals and investments went to a different account.\n\nMizuhara later identified himself as Ohtani in communications with the bank, which allowed him to lift an online banking suspension on the account.\n\nMizuhara began gambling with an illegal sportsbook in 2021, according to prosecutors. Months later, he started losing \"substantial\" amounts of money and, at about the same time, contact information on Ohtani's bank account was changed to link it to Mizuhara's phone number and an anonymous email, prosecutors said.\n\nMizuhara told ESPN on March 19 that Ohtani paid his gambling debts at the interpreter\u2019s request, saying the bets were on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football. But the following day, ESPN said Mizuhara dramatically changed his story, claiming Ohtani had no knowledge of the gambling debts and had not transferred any money to bookmakers.\n\nOhtani and his attorneys have maintained that he was completely unaware of the \u201cmassive theft\" until the news came to light last month when the Dodgers were opening the season in South Korea against the Padres.\n\nMajor League Baseball launched its own investigation concurrent to the federal one by the IRS.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling addiction, please call the National Council on Problem Gambling at 1-800-522-4700 to speak to a counselor.

      "title": "2024 NBA Mock Draft: French players go 1-2, Lakers pass on Bronny James in first round, Celtics take Duke star",
      "news": "Round 1 - Pick 1 Alex Sarr C France \u2022 7'1\" / 217 lbs Projected Team Atlanta PROSPECT RNK 1st POSITION RNK 1st PPG 9.7 RPG 4.4 APG 0.9 3P% 29.8% Worst-case scenario for Sarr? A 7-foot, athletic, rim-running, shot-blocking big with playmaking upside who can finish lobs in the vein of Dereck Lively II. Best-case scenario? The shot continues to develop and now we're talking about a truly special two-way player. One source I talked to said he believes Sarr can be a \"franchise player\" five or six years down the road, so the Hawks won't hesitate to take him No. 1 in a draft sorely lacking high-ceiling prospects.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 2 Zaccharie Risacher SF France \u2022 6'9\" / 204 lbs Projected Team Washington PROSPECT RNK 2nd POSITION RNK 1st PPG 10.1 RPG 3.8 APG 0.9 3P% 35.2% On film, Risacher stands out as possibly the best player in the draft because of his size, athleticism and varied skill set that seems perfectly tailored for the modern NBA. He's stepped his game up considerably overseas as more attention has been sent his way, and the rebuilding Wizards are desperately looking for a potential franchise player to build around. It's a big swing, but Washington could look to repeat the success they had with another French prospect, Bilal Coulibaly, whom they selected in last year's lottery.\n\nFrom From Brooklyn Nets Round 1- Pick 3 Stephon Castle PG Connecticut \u2022 Fr \u2022 6'6\" / 210 lbs Projected Team Houston PROSPECT RNK 3rd POSITION RNK 1st PPG 11.1 RPG 4.7 APG 2.9 3P% 26.7% Do I think Castle is the third-best prospect in this class? No. However, the fit with the Rockets is too perfect to pass up. Ideally they'd like a better shooter here, but Castle's versatility and defensive upside make him a perfect Ime Udoka player as Houston attempts to climb into the postseason picture. I could see Castle having a Josh Hart-like impact on winning from day one with plenty of other Rockets to run the show offensively.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 4 Nikola Topic PG Serbia \u2022 6'6\" / 201 lbs Projected Team San Antonio PROSPECT RNK 5th POSITION RNK 2nd PPG 18.4 RPG 3.6 APG 7.1 3P% 25.9% The Spurs need a guard to run the show and, more importantly, deliver the ball to Victor Wembanyama in advantageous positions. Topic puts relentless pressure on the rim with his powerful frame and finishes at a high clip, which will open up passing angles to Wemby and the other Spurs -- plus he's an excellent pick-and-roll operator with great vision. Topic isn't a floor spacer, but if he can get up to league-average as a 3-point shooter, we could be talking about a future All-Star.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 5 Reed Sheppard SG Kentucky \u2022 Fr \u2022 6'3\" / 181 lbs Projected Team Detroit PROSPECT RNK 7th POSITION RNK 1st PPG 12.5 RPG 4.1 APG 4.5 3P% 52.1% Cade Cunningham needs a backcourt mate who can effectively space the floor, and that's exactly what Sheppard does as the best 3-point shooter in the draft. He's equally adept off the catch and off the dribble, landing in the 99th percentile in both areas during his only college season, per Synergy Sports. Sheppard may not be the best shot creator, but he's more than capable of being a secondary playmaker and is an underrated defender who should be able to hold his own at the NBA level.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 6 Matas Buzelis SF G League Ignite \u2022 6'8\" / 209 lbs Projected Team Charlotte PROSPECT RNK 6th POSITION RNK 3rd PPG 11.8 RPG 5.0 APG 1.7 3P% 22.2% In theory, Buzelis is the perfect next piece for the Hornets, surrounding LaMelo Ball with a long, versatile connector alongside the lob-catching Mark Williams and floor-spacing Brandon Miller. In practice, Buzelis will need to improve his shooting significantly if he's going to reach his ceiling, which could be a Franz Wagner type -- a big playmaker who can also get out and finish in transition.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 7 Cody Williams SG Colorado \u2022 Fr \u2022 6'7\" / 178 lbs Projected Team Portland PROSPECT RNK 16th POSITION RNK 3rd PPG 11.9 RPG 3 APG 1.6 3P% 41.5% Williams is just solid in pretty much every area and looks like he should be able to play right away, with the room to grow into a much more prolific offensive player. He won't rock the boat as Scoot Henderson takes the reins next season, and will fill much needed minutes on the wing with his 3-point shooting, playmaking upside and defensive potential.\n\nFrom From Toronto Raptors Round 1 - Pick 8 Donovan Clingan C Connecticut \u2022 Soph \u2022 7'2\" / 280 lbs Projected Team San Antonio PROSPECT RNK 11th POSITION RNK 2nd PPG 13 RPG 7.4 APG 1.5 3P% 25% The Spurs are going to be much better next season, and Clingan is just the type of known commodity who can come in and impact winning right away. As a backup to Victor Wembanyama (and possibly next to him in some Gregg Popovich lab-concocted super-gigantic lineups), the polished UConn product will provide shot-blocking, screen-setting, rebounding and finishing from the second he sets foot on the floor. Good luck scoring at the rim against San Antonio with at least one of these two monsters on the floor for all 48 minutes.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 9 Dalton Knecht SG Tennessee \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'6\" / 213 lbs Projected Team Memphis PROSPECT RNK 8th POSITION RNK 2nd PPG 21.7 RPG 4.9 APG 1.8 3P% 39.7% A bucket-getter with a sweet shooting stroke, Knecht is the perfect player to put next to Ja Morant, Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr. The 6-foot-5 wing is prolific movement shooter, which will add a new dimension to the Memphis offense. He's also a great cutter who can attack closeouts and finish above the rim with his 6-foot-9 wingspan. Already 23 years old, Knecht's NBA learning curve shouldn't be too steep for a Grizzlies squad hoping to get back into the upper echelon of the Western Conference.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 10 Tidjane Salaun SF France \u2022 6'9\" / 212 lbs Projected Team Utah PROSPECT RNK 10th POSITION RNK 4th PPG 9.0 RPG 4.0 APG 1.0 3P% 32.9% Salaun is shooting up draft boards thanks to his versatile skill set and NBA-ready, athletic frame. He doesn't turn 19 until August, so this is clearly a long-term, upside play for Utah -- but they're certainly a team that can afford to be patient. One source who's seen him play in France told me he thinks Salaun will eventually be a better finished product than countrymen Alex Sarr and Zaccharie Risacher. The Jazz would love to be the beneficiaries of that kind of talent at No. 10.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 11 Rob Dillingham PG Kentucky \u2022 Fr \u2022 6'1\" / 165 lbs Projected Team Chicago PROSPECT RNK 13th POSITION RNK 5th PPG 15.2 RPG 2.9 APG 3.9 3P% 44.4% Nobody's quite clear on the Bulls' direction moving forward, so they should just take the best prospect available -- and here, that's Dillingham. An electric three-level scorer, the Kentucky product measured quite small at the Combine (6-foot-1, 164 pounds), but could still thrive in a current NBA landscape that tends to limit defensive physicality. It's hard not to see shades of Tyrese Maxey and Darius Garland when you watch Dillingham, but his lack of size could ultimately lower his ceiling.\n\nFrom From Houston Rockets Round 1 - Pick 12 Devin Carter PG Providence \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'3\" / 195 lbs Projected Team Oklahoma City PROSPECT RNK 9th POSITION RNK 3rd PPG 19.7 RPG 8.7 APG 3.6 3P% 37.7% The only thing really going against Carter as a prospect is his age (turned 22 in March), but his impressive performance at the combine certainly turned some heads. Owner of a 6-foot-9 wingspan, 42-inch vertical and a sturdy frame, he profiles as a potentially elite defensive prospect. He also averaged nearly 10 rebounds per 40 minutes last season at Providence, absolutely ridiculous for a 6-foot-2 guard and a clear indication of his high motor and basketball IQ. The difference-maker will be whether the 38% he shot from 3-point range last season can translate to the NBA. Either way, OKC will be glad to snatch him up at No. 12.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 13 Jared McCain PG Duke \u2022 Fr \u2022 6'2\" / 203 lbs Projected Team Sacramento PROSPECT RNK 15th POSITION RNK 6th PPG 14.3 RPG 5 APG 1.9 3P% 41.4% Not only is McCain an elite shooting prospect, but he also happens to be a Sacramento native. He should fit in perfectly as a movement shooter capable of running off of all those picks and dribble hand-offs from Domantas Sabonis, and McCain can capably serve as a secondary ball-handler when necessary. He's also a deadly pull-up 3-point marksman, a good piece for a team that wants to play fast.\n\nFrom From Golden State Warriors Round 1 - Pick 14 Ron Holland SF G League Ignite \u2022 6'7\" / 197 lbs Projected Team Portland PROSPECT RNK 4th POSITION RNK 2nd PPG 18.5 RPG 6.7 APG 2.8 3P% 23.9% Holland has the talent of a top-five prospect, but his inefficiency and inconsistent shooting might put him more of the \"development\" category. That's perfect for the Blazers, who aren't slated to compete any time soon. Holland could be a plus defender very quickly and, while the offensive end might take some work, he's an excellent shot creator -- now it's just a matter of making them a bit more often.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 15 Isaiah Collier PG USC \u2022 Fr \u2022 6'3\" / 205 lbs Projected Team Miami PROSPECT RNK 12th POSITION RNK 4th PPG 16.3 RPG 2.9 APG 4.3 3P% 33.8% Once considered among the top players in the class, Collier's stock took a considerable hit during his only season at USC. Now he could become an absolute steal for a team drafting in the teens, and Miami seems like the perfect place for a talented, hard-nosed player with a chip on his shoulder. Collier uses his speed and power to get to the rim and, consequently, to the free throw line. His shooting, decision-making and defense are the main question marks, but you can't argue with the talent.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 16 Tristan da Silva SF Colorado \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'8\" / 217 lbs Projected Team Philadelphia PROSPECT RNK 30th POSITION RNK 10th PPG 16 RPG 5.1 APG 2.4 3P% 39.5% The Sixers are in win-now mode during Joel Embiid's prime, and Da Silva is one of the most NBA-ready players in the draft with the size, frame and skill set to contribute immediately. He's a great cutter who finishes creatively around the basket to make up for his lack of explosiveness, and he profiles as an average to above-average 3-point shooter. Defensively, his basketball IQ is constantly on display and he can guard multiple positions. Da Silva could easily step into a Philadelphia frontcourt rotation that lacks depth.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 17 Ja'Kobe Walter SG Baylor \u2022 Fr \u2022 6'5\" / 197 lbs Projected Team L.A. Lakers PROSPECT RNK 17th POSITION RNK 4th PPG 14.5 RPG 4.4 APG 1.4 3P% 34.1% The Lakers may not keep this pick, but if they do it will be executed with a post-LeBron world in mind. Walter is an intriguing scorer who seems like a better shooter than his 34% mark last season at Baylor would suggest. It might take some time, but with his 6-foot-10 wingspan, he could develop into an elite defender in the vein of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- an archetype with which the Lakers are extremely familiar.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 18 Kyshawn George SG Miami (Fla.) \u2022 Fr \u2022 6'7\" / 209 lbs Projected Team Orlando PROSPECT RNK 26th POSITION RNK 6th PPG 7.6 RPG 3 APG 2.2 3P% 40.8% George is an Orlando Magic player if I've ever seen one, with size and skill to play and guard multiple positions. Most importantly, he was a knock-down shooter in his one season at Miami, particularly off the catch. He could serve as a floor-spacer in Orlando while he develops his ball-handling and playmaking skills -- which I find incredibly intriguing.\n\nFrom From Indiana Pacers Round 1 - Pick 19 Kel'el Ware C Indiana \u2022 Soph \u2022 7'0\" / 230 lbs Projected Team Toronto PROSPECT RNK 37th POSITION RNK 6th PPG 15.9 RPG 9.9 APG 1.5 3P% 42.5% Ware's NBA fit jumps off the page (almost literally) when you watch his film. Lob threats/rim protectors like Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford have shown that players with Ware's profile (and 7-foot-5 wingspan) can immediately contribute to winning. That's his floor, but then you add in the fact that Ware shot 43% from 3-point range last season? This young man could be the steal of the draft, and he'll pair nicely with Toronto's young core of Scottie Barnes, RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 20 Johnny Furphy SG Kansas \u2022 Fr \u2022 6'8\" / 189 lbs Projected Team Cleveland PROSPECT RNK 21st POSITION RNK 5th PPG 9 RPG 4.9 APG 1 3P% 35.2% If you're selecting Furphy it's because you believe in his potential, and his theoretical ceiling is nearly perfect for the Cavs as a 3-point shooter who can also get out and finish in transition. He's also shown signs of being a solid defensive playmaker with steals and blocks, and he'll have to contribute on that end if he's going to stay on the court for the Cavs. Most likely he'll spend most of his rookie year developing, and the benefits could be robust down the line.\n\nFrom From Milwaukee Bucks Round 1 - Pick 21 Carlton Carrington PG Pittsburgh \u2022 Fr \u2022 6'4\" / 195 lbs Projected Team New Orleans PROSPECT RNK 20th POSITION RNK 7th PPG 13.8 RPG 5.2 APG 4.1 3P% 32.2% Who knows what the Pelicans roster will look like come October, so they'll likely just draft the best prospect available at No. 21. To me that's Carrington (better known as Bub), who profiles as a heat-check bucket-getter with a deadly pull-up jumper who can also be a secondary playmaker (think Bones Hyland or Lou Williams, but bigger). He also doesn't turn 19 until this summer, so he likely has plenty of room to develop -- the most immediate area to address is his 3-point shooting.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 22 DaRon Holmes II PF Dayton \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'9\" / 235 lbs Projected Team Phoenix PROSPECT RNK 18th POSITION RNK 1st PPG 20.4 RPG 8.5 APG 2.6 3P% 38.6% Holmes just knows how to play basketball and he'll be 22 by the time his rookie season starts, so he should be able to immediately slot into a Phoenix rotation that desperately needs low-cost, impact players. He plays much bigger than his 6-foot-9 frame, as a smart roller and finisher who can also pop out to 3-point range. Holmes isn't going to create his own shot very often, but he's the perfect player to put next to all of the Suns' top-end scoring and playmaking.\n\nFrom From New Orleans Pelicans Round 1 - Pick 23 Zach Edey C Purdue \u2022 Sr \u2022 7'4\" / 299 lbs Projected Team Milwaukee PROSPECT RNK 27th POSITION RNK 5th PPG 25.2 RPG 12.2 APG 2 3P% 50% The questions about Edey's NBA fit are valid, but there's no better player for him to learn from than Brook Lopez -- and it doesn't hurt that Milwaukee is a hop, skip and a jump from Purdue. In order to succeed, Edey will need to master the art of drop defense, which the Bucks have played for years with Lopez -- a similarly slow-footed 7-plus-footer. Edey should block shots immediately, but the danger comes when he's out in space against NBA-level speed and shot-making. His offensive role is a bit murky, but he should be able to get a few touches here and there in the post, where he dominated in college.\n\nFrom From Dallas Mavericks Round 1 - Pick 24 Baylor Scheierman SG Creighton \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'7\" / 201 lbs Projected Team New York PROSPECT RNK 33rd POSITION RNK 8th PPG 18.5 RPG 9 APG 3.9 3P% 38.1% The Knicks were the second-best 3-point shooting team in the league last year, so they should happily jump at the chance to draft Scheierman, who was a marksman both off the catch and off the dribble at Creighton. He also displayed NBA range, which means there shouldn't be much of an adjustment curve, and he's shown flashes of some secondary playmaking ability. The question will be whether he can hold his own defensively enough to stay on the floor for Tom Thibodeau.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 25 Ryan Dunn SF Virginia \u2022 Soph \u2022 6'6\" / 213 lbs Projected Team New York PROSPECT RNK 23rd POSITION RNK 6th PPG 8.1 RPG 6.9 APG 0.8 3P% 20% Some might not see Dunn as a first-rounder due to his total lack of offensive production in college, but he's the type of game-changing defender who can immediately carve out an NBA role. The prototype for his development would be Herb Jones, who walked into the league as an excellent defender and has since developed into a 42% 3-point shooter. That might not be in Dunn's future, but even if he's more like Matisse Thybulle, he should be able to earn minutes on a contender.\n\nFrom From Los Angeles Clippers Round 1 - Pick 26 Yves Missi C Baylor \u2022 Fr \u2022 6'11\" / 229 lbs Projected Team Washington PROSPECT RNK 22nd POSITION RNK 4th PPG 10.7 RPG 5.6 APG 0.4 3P% 0 Front office execs must love players like Missi, who have virtually no mystery to their game. He's a rim-runner and shot-blocker who wasn't foolish enough to even attempt a 3-pointer in his only season at Baylor. Instead he displayed the type of high motor that should get him a chance at minutes early in his career -- particularly with the rebuilding Wizards.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 27 Tyler Smith PF G League Ignite \u2022 6'9\" / 224 lbs Projected Team Minnesota PROSPECT RNK 31st POSITION RNK 2nd PPG 14.3 RPG 5.2 APG 1.7 3P% 35.2% Smith fits Minnesota's intense craving for length (7-foot-1 wingspan), while also serving as a stretch big to learn from Karl-Anthony Towns and Naz Reid. Defense will be the major issue for Smith, particularly on a team like the Timberwolves, but he could turn into an interesting piece down the line if and when the roster gets too expensive in Minnesota.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 28 Jaylon Tyson SF California \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'6\" / 218 lbs Projected Team Denver PROSPECT RNK 24th POSITION RNK 7th PPG 19.6 RPG 6.8 APG 3.5 3P% 36% The Nuggets learned in their shortened playoff run that they need a little more help off their bench, and Tyson has the frame and experience to contribute right away. He might have been overextended a bit at Cal and got into the habit of overdribbling, but his role will be simplified at the NBA level, allowing him to shine as a big guard who puts pressure on the rim and can knock down the open 3-pointers created by Nikola Jokic and Co.\n\nFrom From Oklahoma City Thunder Round 1 - Pick 29 Bobi Klintman SF Sweden \u2022 6'9\" / 212 lbs Projected Team Utah PROSPECT RNK 25th POSITION RNK 8th PPG 9.7 RPG 4.8 APG 0.7 3P% 35.7% Another draft pick, another development project for the Jazz. Klintman is as intriguing as any prospect in the class, but has yet to put it together at either the college or international level. Utah has plenty of patience, and will take a chance on a stretch-forward who can get out in transition and could eventually become a plus defender.",

      "news": "While there was a new winner for the season last weekend at World Wide Technology Raceway in Austin Cindric, the No. 1 spot still belongs to Denny Hamlin.\n\nThe Joe Gibbs Racing driver continued his hot run with a runner-up finish to Cindric.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the NBC Sports NASCAR Power Rankings after this past weekend\u2019s race:\n\n1. Denny Hamlin (Last week: 1): His runner-up finish was his fifth consecutive top-five finish. To put that into perspective, that\u2019s the same number of top-10 finishes reigning Cup champion Ryan Blaney has this season.\n\n2. Brad Keselowski (3) \u2014 He placed third last weekend for his third consecutive top-three finish. He has finished in the top three in five of the last seven races.\n\n3. Kyle Larson (2) \u2014 He finished 10th despite an incident with Kyle Busch last weekend. Larson has five top 10s in the last eight races, including a win, two runner-up results and a third-place finish.\n\nLarson, Busch spin while battling at WWT Raceway Kyle Larson gets loose under Kyle Busch and slides up into the outside wall, with the No. 8 getting the brunt of the damage during the NASCAR Cup Series race at WWT Raceway.\n\n4. Chase Elliott (4) \u2014 He has finished in the top 10 in six of the last nine races after his 13th-place result last weekend. He has finished no worse than 19th in a race and has seven top 10s through 15 races.\n\n5. William Byron (5) \u2014 His 15th-place finish at WWT Raceway is only the third time in the last 10 races he has failed to score a top-10 result.\n\n6. Tyler Reddick (8) \u2014 Back-to-back fourth-place finishes has the 23XI Racing driver moving up the rankings.\n\n7. Christopher Bell (9) \u2014 Was in position for his third victory of the season until his engine soured while dueling Ryan Blaney for the lead late in last weekend\u2019s race. Bell managed to finish seventh for his third top 10 in the last four races.\n\n8. Alex Bowman (7) \u2014 His streak of five consecutive top 10 finishes ended at WWT Raceway when he placed 28th.\n\n9. Ty Gibbs (10) \u2014 Just missed his third top 10 in a row with an 11th-place result at WWT Raceway.\n\n10. Martin Truex Jr. (6) \u2014 His 34th-place result last weekend is his third finish in a row outside the top 10. He has finished outside the top 10 in five of the last seven races.",

The betting firm would also take an equity stake in the media company, as well as reselling Diamond\u2019s streaming service to its customers and fans.\n\nFlutter Entertainment-owned FanDuel is now one of the biggest gambling companies in the US, with US$4.4 billion in annual gaming revenues.

The partnership is expected to expire at the end of the current Major League Baseball (MLB) season later this year.\n\nThe media company is currently working to restructure its operations alongside creditors, after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2023. Its finances have been hit from a fall in pay-TV subscribers and the lack of a viable direct-to-consumer (DTC) product.\n\nAt a bankruptcy court hearing last month, DSG claimed a new naming rights deals for its RSNs was close, as part of its argument that it had made progress towards exiting bankruptcy. It has secured carriage deals with several major cable distributors in Charter, DirecTV and Cox, but currently remains without an agreement with Comcast.\n\nDSG has come under criticism from Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL) for not sharing details regarding its long-term plans.

      "title": "Ranking NFL's new coach-quarterback duos for 2024: Falcons, Chargers headline teams that underwent big change",
      "news": "The 2024 NFL offseason saw plenty of big names swap places at the most important spots: coach and quarterback. In fact, 12 different teams -- almost 40% of the league -- are set to open the new season with a new pairing there.\n\nSo which new duo is most promising? We're ranking all 12 as the summer draws near. A few clarifiers:\n\nA team needs just one new starting quarterback or coach to qualify (i.e. Justin Herbert has been the Los Angeles Chargers' signal-caller for four years, but he's paired with Jim Harbaugh for the first time). Last year, for reference, there were three teams to have both. This year, there are four.\n\nWho qualifies as a \"new\" quarterback? Any projected starter who didn't start Week 1 or multiple games for his team the year prior.\n\nWe're ranking duos, not their respective teams. That said, quarterback-coach duos can be a good indicator of a team's standing. Chances are, if your favorite team's pairing is high on the list, they're better positioned to overcome other weaknesses on the roster.\n\n\n\nNow let's get to it:\n\n*New on team\n\nBrissett is well regarded as a spot starter, showing a steady hand in unsteady situations. He's also never posted a winning record in a top role. His conservative approach may pair well with Mayo's defensive direction, but the ceiling feels inherently low here, which just makes No. 3 overall draft pick Drake Maye all the more intriguing. Could he take over sooner rather than later?\n\n11. Raiders: Gardner Minshew (QB)*, Antonio Pierce (HC)*\n\nPierce has already earned rave internal reviews for restoring the Raiders' culture, but we've only seen him lead nine games as interim coach, and he's working with the definition of an \"in-progress\" quarterback situation: Whether it's the gutsy journeyman Minshew or the old-school young incumbent Aidan O'Connell, Las Vegas once again feels as if it's treading water under center.\n\n10. Broncos: Bo Nix (QB)*, Sean Payton (HC)\n\nThe rookie Nix isn't guaranteed the Week 1 gig, but at 24, with extensive college experience, he's got the edge over Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson. All indications are his ultra-efficient approach aligns with Payton's short-area attack. But he's a projection, and Payton's peak New Orleans Saints days of calling a dominant offense feel like an increasingly distant memory.\n\n9. Commanders: Jayden Daniels (QB)*, Dan Quinn (HC)\n\nDaniels oozes athletic upside, giving Washington arguably its most dynamic dual-threat passer since early-career Robert Griffin III. But durability is a concern, as it was with RG3, and Quinn may be an even bigger wild card: His defensive background is impressive, but he hasn't overseen a winning team since 2017, when he deployed Matt Ryan and Julio Jones in their prime.\n\n8. Panthers: Bryce Young (QB), Dave Canales (HC)*\n\nYoung was two steps behind NFL speed in a listless 2023 debut, and his smaller frame remains a concern, but the former No. 1 overall pick has a more inspiring advocate this time around. After maximizing Geno Smith and Baker Mayfield in separate stops, Canales could be just the energizer needed to lessen Young's burden and restore the quarterback's pocket poise.\n\n7. Bears: Caleb Williams (QB)*, Matt Eberflus (HC)\n\nAs a \"generational\" talent and No. 1 overall pick, Williams is doing a lot of the heavy lifting here, considering Eberflus went 10-24 -- and never steadied the exiled Justin Fields' setup -- before his arrival. But Eberflus did oversee a defensive rejuvenation late in 2023, and Williams' supercharged gunslinging should be aided by an upgraded group of skill weapons.\n\n6. Steelers: Russell Wilson (QB)*, Mike Tomlin (HC)\n\nAt 35, Wilson is no longer the ever-elusive big-play artist of his Super Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks days, but he's probably slightly steadier than he showed in his tumultuous Broncos stint. Working with an old-school, ground-and-pound leader like Tomlin feels like a perfect match. But the more tantalizing gifts of the young Justin Fields loom large in the background.\n\n5. Titans: Will Levis (QB), Brian Callahan (HC)*\n\nA big, bruising second-round rookie in 2023, Levis was erratic in nine starts to open his NFL career, but he's got unteachable juice as both a power thrower and runner. Not only does he have improved weaponry going into his first full year as \"the guy,\" but a new coach in Callahan who had a direct hand in Joe Burrow's confident start with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThis is far too high for Darnold by himself; the ex-New York Jets prospect has only flashed in spurts, and first-round rookie J.J. McCarthy -- a potential play-action savant -- could usurp him sooner rather than later. But O'Connell got Grade-A stuff from Kirk Cousins, and his positive leadership is felt in that building. Minnesota is primed to compete regardless of who's under center.\n\n3. Seahawks: Geno Smith (QB), Mike Macdonald (HC)*\n\nAt 33, coming off a so-so, injury-dotted season, Smith may or may not be the long-term answer in Seattle. But he's had a knack for timely darts since reviving his career with the Seahawks and still boasts solid weapons. Macdonald, meanwhile, should help give Smith and the offense some long-awaited defensive support after overseeing the fast, physical and versatile Baltimore Ravens.\n\n2. Falcons: Kirk Cousins (QB)*, Raheem Morris (HC)*\n\nAtlanta's surprise top-10 pick of Michael Penix Jr. proved the club isn't necessarily as sold on Cousins as we all thought back in March, but even approaching 36, coming off a torn Achilles, the ex-Minnesota Vikings captain brings much-needed stability to the focal point of a growing offense. Morris, meanwhile, is a likable leader whose defensive prowess should balance the lineup.\n\n1. Chargers: Justin Herbert (QB), Jim Harbaugh (HC)*\n\nQuestions about Herbert's reassembled supporting cast aside, this is easily the most talented and/or accomplished pairing of the bunch. While big-stage questions remain, Herbert has all the physical tools and early-career marks of a perennial Pro Bowl pocket passer. And Harbaugh, despite a nine-year hiatus from the NFL, has led triumphant programs wherever he's gone. The former Michigan and San Francisco 49ers coach should bring added discipline and old-school toughness to Los Angeles, helping Herbert and Co. attack the AFC West with a new level of confidence.",

      "news": "The Phoenix Suns are stuck financially, which will be a good thing for Royce O\u2019Neale.\n\nThe Suns have $150.7 million committed next season to their big three: Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal. The NBA\u2019s salary cap is expected to be about $141 million. Add in the salaries for Jusuf Nurkic ($18.1 million), Grayson Allen ($15.6 million), and Nassir Little ($6.8 million), and the Suns are above the dreaded second apron tax with just six players, they need at least eight more to fill out the roster. And with the Suns wanting to contend, they can\u2019t just fill out the roster with minimum players, they need quality role players, and those guys cost a little more.\n\nEnter Royce O\u2019Neale, who played well for the Suns in his 25 minutes a night, averaging 8.1 points and 5.2 rebounds a game while shooting 37.6% off the bench (he was traded by Brooklyn to Phoenix at the deadline). He\u2019s the kind of solid role player the Suns want to keep around, but O\u2019Neale is a free agent and likely to get a raise off the $9.5 million he made last season.\n\nThe Suns can\u2019t afford to replace him, and they have his Bird rights, so they are expected to step up and pay him. Brian Windhorst of ESPN discussed this on his Hoop Collective podcast.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to re-sign Royce O\u2019Neale. That\u2019s going to get done.\u201d\n\nIt would make sense for the Suns to pay O\u2019Neale more than just market value. While that will hurt against the luxury tax, it makes it more likely the Suns can trade him for another player if needed \u2014 because the Suns are over the second apron they have to take back less money in a trade than they send out, overpaying O\u2019Neale a little opens up the pool of players he can be traded for.\n\nPut simply, the Suns have to re-sign O\u2019Neale, they can\u2019t let him walk for nothing because they can\u2019t easily replace him. That\u2019s going to be very good for O\u2019Neale\u2019s bank account.",

      "title": "Baseball gambling scandals: Padres' Tucupita Marcano joins Shohei Ohtani's interpreter, Pete Rose, Black Sox",
      "news": "San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano has been permanently banned from Major League Baseball for violating the league's gambling policy. Marcano bet more than $150,000 on baseball games, including on his own team, then the Pirates, though he was on the injured list at the time. Four other players were also suspended for a year for betting on baseball, though not their own team.\n\nIt's been an eventful season for MLB on the illegal or otherwise improper gambling front.\n\nThe regular season was ushered in with controversy, as Shohei Ohtani's longtime interpreter Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Dodgers organization amid allegations of illegal gambling. It's worth noting that Mizuhara was not accused of gambling on baseball (though he has agreed to plead guilty to other charges). MLB personnel are allowed to bet on non-diamond sports (in other words, not baseball or softball) provided -- and this is the important part of the situation -- sports gambling is legal in their jurisdiction.\n\nGambling remains illegal in California, leading Mizuhara to allegedly place bets with Mathew Bowyer, an accused bookmaker at the center of a larger investigation. Mizuhara wasn't the only member of an MLB organization with ties to Bowyer. MLB has since launched an investigation into Atlanta Braves minor-league infielder/pitcher David Fletcher, also on the grounds that he placed illegal bets with Bowyer.\n\nWherever the investigations into Marcano, Fletcher, and others go, it's worth knowing that organized baseball and gambling have a long and oftentimes sordid history.\n\nIn light of all these allegations, CBS Sports felt this would be an appropriate time to revisit some of that history by highlighting some of the most notable scandals and stories. (Do note that this article is intended to be a brief, incomplete overview and is not a suitable replacement for a full-fledged education on these incidents.)\n\n1865: The New York City Mutuals make history\n\nAlthough the Mutuals were an amateur team, they're worth including because they represent the first time in documented history that a baseball club was tempted into game-fixing or gambling.\n\nThe Society for American Baseball Research went into great detail about the Mutuals' game-fixing allegations in 2013, noting that three members of the team \"conspired with a gambler to throw a game to the Eckfords of Brooklyn.\" Those players were, for a time, banned by the National Association of Baseball Players.\n\n1871: Chadwick scolds league as gambling reaches the pros\n\nThe National Association, formed in 1871, was the first professional baseball league. It didn't last long, as it was littered with game-fixing attempts and allegations.\n\nBaseball Hall of Fame journalist Henry Chadwick, later christened as the \"Father of Baseball,\" became an outspoken critic of the National Association's ways. At one point, he wrote the following, per \"The Cheater's Guide to Baseball\" by Derek Zumsteg: \"No positive proof can be brought forward in support of any direct charges of collusion among players for fraudulent purposes but not one man out of ten who witnessed the majority of games of October last can be persuaded that the contests were fairly or honorably contested.\"\n\nThe National Association folded in 1875, with teams leaving to form the National League -- a creation that Zumsteg wrote in \"The Cheater's Guide to Baseball\" was \"intended to be better organized, more businesslike, and set higher standards than the National Association.\" Notably, the National League continued to allow known crooked players to partake, undermining those efforts in the process.\n\n1877: Grays mess around, find out\n\nThe National League would soon face its own game-fixing allegations, when a league investigation uncovered evidence linking utility player Al Nichols to gamblers. Several members of the Louisville Grays then admitted to throwing exhibition games for money. They were each banned from the National League as a result.\n\nLet's skip ahead several decades -- and dozens upon dozens of other gambling and game-fixing-related stories of various significance -- shall we?\n\n1903: Criger rejects offer to throw first World Series\n\nYou may know that the first modern World Series was played between Cy Young's Boston Americans and the Pittsburgh Pirates. Did you know that a gambler's attempt to fix the series was thwarted by Americans' backstop Lou Criger, who alerted American League president Ban Johnson after receiving a letter from the individual that promised him $12,000 in exchange for throwing games, according to the Omaha Morning Bee.\n\nThe Sporting News' obituary for Criger in 1934 states that Johnson later repaid Criger for his integrity, using league funds to help provide care for Criger when he became stricken with tuberculosis.\n\nWith the acknowledgement that game-fixing allegations persisted throughout the coming years, let's again skip ahead -- to when they boiled over and resulted in the most infamous example of game-fixing in the sport's history.\n\n1919: The Black Sox Scandal\n\nYup, here we have the most consequential game-fixing scandal in professional baseball (and arguably professional sports) history. It occurred when the Chicago White Sox lost the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. The White Sox were accused of throwing the series in exchange for money from crime boss Arnold Rothstein. This is, in short, why \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson has remained a household name more than a century on.\n\nAlthough the White Sox later went to trial, with a grand jury finding them not guilty on all charges, eight players were banned for life by Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, installed as the league's first commissioner in 1920 in response to the scandal.\n\nWhether or not Landis' punishments were fair or reasonable has remained a debated issue. But, as SABR's Bill Lamb once noted, \"Game-fixing virtually disappeared from the major-league landscape after that penalty was imposed on the Black Sox.\"\n\nEven so, the Black Sox suspensions weren't the last time personnel were punished for their connections to gambling.\n\n1947: Dodgers' Durocher receives suspension\n\nLeo Durocher was a three-time All-Star shortstop who later enjoyed a lengthy, Hall-of-Fame career as a manager. In 1947, though, he was suspended for the season by Commissioner Happy Chandler because of his \"accumulation of unpleasant incidents.\" Among them? His embracing of and association with gamblers.\n\nIn Paul Dickson's biography on Durocher, then-shortstop Pee Wee Reese is quoted as saying \"It seemed like we always had someone hanging around that was a gambler and a bookie.\"\n\nDickson adds that Brooklyn Dodgers executive Branch Rickey found out that several players were prone to gambling on horse racing and high-stakes poker games. There was no evidence that anyone had gambled on baseball, however. That included Durocher, who was permitted to return to the dugout for the 1948 season.\n\n1970: McLain suspended for ties to gambling\n\nNearly a quarter of a century later, Commissioner Bowie Kuhn suspended Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain indefinitely for \"1967 bookmaking activities and his associations at that time.\"\n\nA New York Times article on McLain's suspension heavily references Sports Illustrated's reporting, which suggests McLain suffered an injured foot that sidelined him during a pennant race after he was stomped by a hoodlum following his and his partners' failure to \"pay a debt of nearly $46,600.\"\n\nMcLain, who would then win 31 games in 1968, was permitted to return to the mound in July of 1970.\n\n1980, 1983: Mays and Mantle suspended\n\nIf you need further evidence that Commissioner Kuhn took any ties between baseball and gambling seriously, consider how he later placed retired Hall of Famers Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle on the permanently ineligible list after they took ambassador jobs with casinos. Kuhn even told Mays \"a casino is no place for a baseball hero and Hall of Famer,\" according to a 2020 article by scribe Craig Calcaterra.\n\nMays and Mantle would remain unable to work in baseball for the rest of Kuhn's tenure. Kuhn's successor, Peter Ueberroth, reinstated them in 1985 -- albeit, notably, without taking any issue or exception with Kuhn's original ruling.\n\n1989: Rose banished\n\nAfter Ueberroth resigned in 1989, his successor Bart Giamatti embarked on an eventful five-month tenure prior to his death. To this day, Giamatti is best remembered for banning Cincinnati Reds legend and player-manager Pete Rose after an investigation into whether or not Rose bet on baseball during his time at the helm.\n\nRose would repeatedly deny the allegations until 2004, when he admitted that he had only gambled on games in which he had managed. An ESPN investigation in 2015 suggested that Rose had also gambled on games in which he had played in.\n\nAlthough Rose's banishment stands to this day -- preventing him from being elected into Cooperstown -- he had been allowed to return closer to the game, serving as an analyst on FOX's coverage. The Philadelphia Phillies had intended to enshrine him in the team's Wall of Fame in 2017, but they canceled those plans after a woman accused Rose of having a sexual relationship with her during the 1970s, when she was underage.\n\nRose, by the way, placed Ohio's first legal sports bet in January 2023. Perhaps time is indeed a flat circle.\n\n2024: A tidal wave of allegations\n\nThat brings this brief history to the present day, with Mizuhara reaching a plea bargain, Marcano being banned for life, and Oakland Athletics reliever Michael Kelly and minor-league players Jay Groome (Padres pitcher), Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez (Philadelphia Phillies infielder) and Andrew Saalfrank (Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher) being suspended for a year. Fletcher is waiting to learn his fate.\n\nAt minimum, it's clear that professional baseball's attitude toward gambling has changed a lot as sports betting has become legal across the country. Whereas any kind of association with a casino used to be enough to get a beloved retired player placed on the ineligible list, the league itself is now partnered with the gambling industry. Indeed, Commissioner Rob Manfred named MGM Resorts the first \"Official Gaming Partner of Major League Baseball\" back in 2018. And, last March, MLB touted a multi-year agreement with FanDuel that made it \"a co-exclusive Official Sports Betting Partner of MLB.\"\n\nWhether that's for the better or the worse is to be determined over the long haul. If nothing else, it ensures that professional baseball and gambling will remain more than mere acquaintances.",

Thanks for signing up! Keep an eye on your inbox. Sorry! There was an error processing your subscription.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Good morning to everyone, but especially to ...\n\nJUSTIN JEFFERSON AND THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS\n\nThere's a new richest non-quarterback contract in NFL history, and it's hard to find anyone more deserving. Justin Jefferson agreed to a four-year, $140 million extension that includes $110 million guaranteed and over $88 million at signing.\n\nYou shouldn't need the stats to prove Jefferson's incredible career, but just in case, here they are:\n\nThe production: Jefferson's 98.3 yards receiving per game is on pace for most in a career in NFL history. The current mark belongs to Calvin Johnson at 86.1.\n\nat 86.1. No empty stats: Since entering the NFL in 2020, Jefferson's 0.43 expected points added per target ranks third in the NFL (min. 100 targets) behind only Brandon Aiyuk and Tee Higgins .\n\nand . Quarterback's best friend: According to NFL Next Gen Stats, Jefferson has 40 more catches than expected (based on several factors, like defenders' positioning, depth of target, etc.), most in the NFL since 2020.\n\nThat last point means a lot considering Minnesota is transitioning from Kirk Cousins to first-round rookie J.J. McCarthy and/or Sam Darnold. Wrapping up Jefferson, 24, through 2028 is just one of many reasons the Vikings have crushed this offseason, Cody Benjamin writes.\n\nWide receivers as a whole are happy, too. Jefferson ($35 million per year) is one of five wide receivers making over $28 million per year. Four of those five signed their contracts this offseason. That means CeeDee Lamb, Ja'Marr Chase, Brandon Aiyuk and Tee Higgins are likely up next for huge paydays. Furthermore, agent Drew Rosenhaus suggested Tyreek Hill is looking for more money from the Dolphins in the aftermath of Jefferson's deal.\n\n\ud83d\ude01 Honorable mentions\n\n\u26be And not such a good morning for ...\n\nGetty Images\n\nTUCUPITA MARCANO\n\nPadres infielder Tucupita Marcano is under MLB investigation for allegedly violating the league's gambling policy, an MLB spokesperson confirmed to CBS Sports.\n\nMarcano, 24, is accused of gambling on Pirates games while he was on Pittsburgh's injured list last year. If he is found to have broken the rules, he faces a lifetime ban.\n\n\n\ngames while he was on Pittsburgh's injured list last year. If he is found to have broken the rules, he faces a lifetime ban. Marcano joined the Padres as an amateur free agent in 2016 and debuted for San Diego in 2021. He was traded to Pittsburgh in 2021 and played for the Pirates in 2022 and 2023.\n\nHe rejoined the Padres in November 2023 but has not played in a game this season due to a torn ACL.\n\nFour minor-league players have also been accused of gambling on MLB games.\n\n\n\nMLB players can legally gamble on non-diamond sports but cannot gamble on any level of baseball or softball. Those who gamble on diamond sports face a one-year ban on first offense and a lifetime ban if they gamble on their own team.\n\nGambling scandals have marred the still-young MLB season. In March, Ippei Mizuhara -- Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter -- was charged with stealing more than $16 million from Ohtani to pay off gambling debts to an illegal bookie. Mizuhara faces up to 33 years in prison. David Fletcher, currently a Braves minor leaguer, is being investigated for placing bets with that same bookie. Neither Mizuhara nor Fletcher are accused of betting on baseball.\n\nR.J. Anderson has a full history of baseball betting scandals.\n\nGambling scandals aren't limited to baseball, of course, and they have become more prevalent recently, with legalized gambling on the rise. Since the start of 2023, in addition to the scandals above ...\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down prohibitions on sports gambling in 2018.\n\n\ud83d\ude14 Not so honorable mentions\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 NBA Finals expert picks: Our staff is split\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nIt may not be the NBA Finals matchup we expected -- at least on one side of the bracket -- but it's setting up to be a thrilling one.\n\nOut of the West, we have an offensive supernova, an absolute force, a superstar of the highest order taking to the biggest stage for the first time in Luka Doncic. His Mavericks supporting cast, led by a rejuvenated Kyrie Irving, trade deadline acquisitions P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford and rookie surprise (even to himself) Dereck Lively II is nothing to sneeze at. Dallas is in its first Finals since 2011.\n\nOut of the East, we have the Celtics, who are no stranger to postseason success. Over the past eight seasons, Boston has won more playoff games than anyone, but they're still looking for their first title since a Doc Rivers-led squad featuring Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and an emerging Rajon Rondo beat the Lakers in 2008. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, the mainstays of this era of Boston hoops, still lead the charge, but Kristaps Porzingis, Jrue Holiday and Derrick White supplement one of the best teams we've seen in a long time.\n\nDoncic can stake another claim to best-in-the-world status. Brown and Tatum can finally complete the biggest task from a successful-yet-incomplete era and answer all lingering questions. There's plenty of intrigue, drama and great basketball to come.\n\nThat's why our experts are exactly split on their picks. Sam Quinn likes Dallas.\n\nQuinn: \"If the Thunder and Timberwolves struggled to get to the rim against Dallas, I think Boston will too, and I'm not going to bet on them to make enough contested triples to win this series that way. A healthy Porzingis might offer their offense enough space and enough versatility to swing this thing, but until I see how he looks on the floor in a high-leverage moment, I'm just not going to believe he's in the kind of shape he'd need to be for Boston to win this series.\"\n\nColin Ward-Henninger, meanwhile, took Boston.\n\nWard-Henninger: \"So, to me, this series comes down to which team will more consistently sustain excellence. Despite having a path to the Finals paved in gold, the Celtics have given us no reason to believe that they won't continue to be the juggernaut we've seen all season long. Most importantly, they have a versatile defensive roster seemingly created to make life hell for players like Doncic and Irving.\"\n\nWe'll have plenty more in the coming days, so stay tuned!\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 WNBA Power Rankings: Sun's suffocating defense has them No. 1\n\nGetty Images\n\nLet's look at some numbers from the Sun's 8-0 start to the season:\n\nSeventh WNBA team to start 8-0\n\nFive games from tying the best start to a season (2016 Lynx started 13-0)\n\nstarted 13-0) Best defensive rating in the WNBA this season (89.1)\n\nBut here's my favorite: The Sun already have two games allowing 50 points or fewer this season, the first team with multiple such games in a season since 2008. They're the first team to do it multiple times within their first eight games since the 2001 Cleveland Rockers.\n\nSo, yeah, it's not fun to play the Sun. Add five double-digit scorers to the mix, and Connecticut is an easy call atop Jack Maloney's WNBA Power Rankings.\n\nSun Liberty Aces Lynx Storm\n\nCowboys legend, Pro Football Hall of Famer Larry Allen dies at 52\n\nGetty Images\n\nHall of Fame offensive lineman Larry Allen, a longtime stalwart for the Cowboys and one of the most decorated linemen ever, died suddenly on Sunday while on vacation in Mexico with his family. He was 52 years old.\n\nAllen, drafted by Dallas in the second round in 1994, played a dozen seasons with the Cowboys and the final two years of his career with the 49ers .\n\n. The career accolades are astonishing: 11 Pro Bowl selections, six first-team All-Pro selections, one Super Bowl ring and selections to both the All-1990s and All-2000s Pro Football Hall of Fame All-Decade teams.\n\nHe was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013, two years after he was inducted into the Cowboys Ring of Honor.\n\nAt 6-foot-3 and 335 pounds, Allen was an incredible athlete who played every offensive line position except center throughout his marvelous career, opening up gaping holes for the NFL's all-time leading rusher, Emmitt Smith. Offensive linemen rarely make highlights, but Allen was an exception, bulldozing defenders, running alongside or faster than players much smaller than him and lifting jaw-dropping amounts of weight.\n\nBryan DeArdo ranks Allen as a top-10 player -- and the top offensive lineman -- in Cowboys history.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa What we're watching Tuesday\n\n\u26be Twins at Yankees, 7:05 p.m. on TBS\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 Liberty at Sky, 8 p.m. on NBA TV\n\n\u26bd USWNT vs. South Korea, 8 p.m. on truTV\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 Mercury at Storm, 10 p.m. on CBS Sports Network",

      "title": "MLB hands lifetime ban to Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano for betting on baseball, 4 others suspended",
      "news": "Marcano allegedly bet on multiple Pirates games last season when he was on their injured list\n\nMajor League Baseball has banned San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano from the game for life after their internal investigation discovered that Marcano had placed bets on baseball games involving his own team while on the injured list during the 2023 season. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report on MLB's latest gambling scandal.\n\nAccording to MLB's press release, Marcano, 24, placed 387 baseball-related bets from Oct. 16, 2022 to Nov. 1, 2023, totaling over $150,000. 231 of those bets were placed on MLB games (for a total of $87,319), and 25 of those 231 bets involved the Pittsburg Pirates, the team he was on at the time, though he was on the injured list and not playing due to a season-ending injury (from which he is still recovering). The vast majority of Marcano's bets were placed after he was injured.\n\nMLB's investigation found that Marcano lost every parlay involving the Pirates, and won only 4.3% of his MLB bets. Marcano denies that he compromised or manipulated the Pirates games he bet on, and MLB found no evidence to contradict that.\n\nMarcano and the Players Association have yet to comment. The Padres released a statement on Monday when the Wall Street Journal published their report.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres,\" the Padres said in a statement, via The Wall Street Journal. \"We will not have any further comment until the investigative process has been completed.\u201d\n\nMLB also announced that four other players have been suspended one year for gambling on baseball: Oakland Athletics reliever Michael Kelly, and three minor leaugers: Padres pitcher Jay Groome, Philadelphia Phillies infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, and Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Andrew Saalfrank.\n\nMarcano held a career-high .233 batting average last season with the Pirates. He had 18 RBI, 47 hits and three home runs in 75 games. He tore his ACL in late July, and missed the rest of the season as a result.\n\nTucupita Marcano SS - SD - #16 2023 - false season 202 AB .233 AVG 3 HR 5 SB .633 OPS\n\nThe gambling allegations against Marcano are just the latest in the league and the sports world in general in recent months. Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter pleaded guilty to charges after he reportedly stole nearly $17 million from Ohtani to cover his illegal gambling losses. Ohtani was not involved in that scandal, which dominated the sport in the lead-up to the season.\n\nToronto Raptors player Jontay Porter was given a lifetime ban from the NBA earlier this year, too, after the league said he purposely limited his participation in games for betting purposes and for betting on games. Porter, who is the brother of Denver Nuggets star Michael Porter Jr., was on a two-way deal with the franchise.\n\nWest Ham midfielder Lucas Paquet\u00e1 was charged by the English Football Association for allegedly breaching their betting rules last month. Former Alabama baseball coach Brad Bohannon was fired after a friend of his tried to make a $100,000 bet on the team. The NFL has cracked down on gambling, too, as several players have been hit with suspensions for violating gambling rules either while in the league or while in college.\n\nLike in the NFL, Major League Baseball's gambling policy prohibits players from placing any bets on baseball. They are allowed to bet on other sports legally. Any player who places a wager on a baseball game involving a team other than their own receives a one-year suspension, but betting on your own team leads to a lifetime ban.",

A global launch is planned for later this year.\n\nSince Messi\u2019s arrival to Major League Soccer, the league said that it has seen its sponsorship revenue grow 15% to $587 million, with some big names like Celsius becoming its official energy drink. The league didn\u2019t immediately comment on the potential new rival from Messi.\n\nMas+ by Messi comes in four flavors. M\u00e1s+ Next Generation Beverage Co.\n\nThe drink is part of a new non-alcoholic beverage unit for Mark Anthony Brands, the owner of White Claw and Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonade. The company has been expanding its portfolio with new non-alcoholic options, including White Claw 0% Alcohol Seltzer, as consumers dial back drinking and the categories blur.\n\nHydration and energy drinks are projected to be a $60 billion market by 2032, growing roughly 6% annually, according to Precedence Research.\n\nStill, attaching Messi\u2019s name to a beverage doesn\u2019t guarantee success, since it\u2019s a competitive category dominated by established competitors, according to Andrea Hern\u00e1ndez, founder of Snaxshot, a food and beverage insights platform.\n\n\u201cThe category is saturated, so it all comes down to price parity and distribution, assuming Messi has secured some good deals to try and actually compete with not only Prime but also Gatorade, BodyArmor and others,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThe only advantage they carry is tied to Messi\u2019s image.\u201d\n\nHowever, his \u201cfandom extends wide, and he\u2019s almost hero-like for new generation of upcoming athletes, particularly in a massive market like Latin America,\u201d she said, adding that Prime\u2019s popularity and distribution hasn\u2019t yet extended to that region.\n\nShe also notes that the Messi\u2019s drinks are using cane sugar, a new trend with beverages since some zero sugar drinks are turning off some people because of its taste.\n\n\u201cPeople forget having a good tasting product also goes a long way,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cGen Alpha is up for grabs, and that is who these new generation energy drinks are aiming to capture especially as they enter teenage years.\u201d",

      "title": "Financial dangers of store credit cards can be \u2018severe,\u2019 expert warns",
      "news": "Nearly every store has rewards credit cards available for customers, but not all the offers add up to major savings. These offers are often the \"genesis\" of long-term issues, one personal finance expert warns.\n\n\"There's just a trickle effect that could last maybe years for that consumer,\" financial planner and \"What Should I Do With My Money?\" author Bryan Kuderna told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"They're like, oh, you know, I got 50 bucks off of buying that sofa that maybe I didn't even really want in the first place, and then\u2026 you look at what that did to their financial plan. And it's kind of amazing sometimes to see what the genesis of [what] some of these issues was.\"\n\nFINANCE EXPERT SOUNDS ALARM OVER \u2018SPAVING\u2019 TREND: AN OLD \u2018TRAP\u2019 WITH A NEW NAME HITTING YOUR WALLET\n\nStore credit cards are similar to other \"spaving\" ploys from retailers designed to make consumers spend more to save. Unlike other deals, like buy one, get one sales, credit cards come with long-term financial risks.\n\nRetailers offer consumers two card options \u2013 a store card only accepted at a certain retailer or family of brands and a co-branded card that can be used widely. The cards are primarily pitched to consumers at point-of-purchase rather than having to complete an application process or go to the bank.\n\nThe quick sales-pitch nature of the card pitch can \"rope in\" unsuspecting consumers and prompt a \"trickle down\" effect on their financial plans.\n\n\"A lot of people, they don't intend to open up a new credit card today when they go to Costco or Walmart or even when they sign on to Amazon or whatever the case might be,\" Kuderna explained. \"Then they get that alert or the person at the register says, 'hey, would you be interested in opening a store credit card? You can get all of today's purchases half off.' You know something that sounds like almost too good to be true, which usually does mean it's too good to be true.\"\n\nGEN Z LEAN ON CREDIT MORE THAN MILLENNIALS DID AND RACKING UP MORE DEBT\n\nKuderna went on to explain the \"severe\" financial dangers of impulsively applying for retail credit cards.\n\n\"[The cards] might be attractive. They might rope us in. But if we cannot pay off that debt, and we're stuck paying the interest or any late payment fees and so forth,\" Kuderna stressed.\n\n\"With these kind of point of purchase offers, there's not time for homework,\" he added. \"Some people just say, 'I didn't intend on opening a credit card, but now here I am. I opened a card and now what is that going to be in over the next two years for myself, my budget and my credit score.'\"\n\nOpening the card gives an initial hit to an individual's credit score with a credit inquiry. Credit scores are critical to buying power and can help consumers save on payments and interest rates for big purchases like homes and vehicles.\n\nAfter the initial credit inquiry, high interest rates, late payment fees and even inactivity clauses can bring recurring disasters for consumers.\n\n\"Oftentimes these type of cards have a low credit limit, which means as you use it, your utilization ratio looks very high, which is not good. And then, if we're not using the card for a period of time, they may end up just closing the card on us, which then reduces our credit limit. Again, not good for our credit score,\" Kuderna explained.\n\n\"What they may end up spending in interest on their store credit card or late payment fees or anything else could pale in comparison to that little savings that they got at one time when they opened the credit card.\"\n\nCREDIT CARD DEBT IS SURGING AS AVERAGE AMERICAN OWES $6,218\n\nAccording to data from Bankrate, interest rates for retail credit cards have hit a new record high at 28.93% as of October 2023. Kuderna warned the high rates make it difficult for shoppers to maximize the card's incentives and can lead to customers paying more in interest than they are making in savings.\n\n\"If you simply look at that math there, you could see how much in favor that is to the issuing company, the credit card company or the retail store.\" - Bryan Kuderna\n\n\"The interest that they're going to charge, the possible penalties that could be involved, the fine print on the card, the inactivity clauses, if you're not using the card, there could be so many strings attached.\"\n\nRetail cards also often provide offers for young buyers and shoppers with poor credit to acquire a new credit card. Subprime lending, also called predatory lending, can be a great opportunity, but it is also an aspect which Kuderna says consumers should \"be extremely careful\" about.\n\nThe \"spaving\" offer also acts similar to a subscription model. If a retailer can \"hook in\" a customer with a store card, it can create a returning buyer and potentially increase profits for that retailer. It also means consumers must face \"difficult choices\" when it comes to finances.\n\n\"We're doing all that for just this immediate gratification because of the intro offer. But again, the long-term effects here. We don't notice them immediately, but they're there. And then, as they compound with other department stores, other online retailers, that's where people can really get in a mess without having intended to ever be there,\" Kuderna explained.\n\nWhile there are \"severe\" pitfalls to opening a retail card, Kuderna outlined that the credit cards could be \"a win-win, but you really need to do some homework on that.\"\n\nFor those looking to open a store card, Kuderna urged consumers to evaluate the kind of card they applied for and whether the particular retailer is a place one shops \"frequently.\" In addition, consumers who do apply for a card should practice paying off balances immediately.\n\nOther tips include viewing the retail card like any conventional credit card, practicing good budgeting and remembering not to take on more debt than you are capable of paying off.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",

      "news": "Israel\u2019s budget deficit could run into double digits by the end of 2024 and could cause international financial actors to lose trust in Israel\u2019s economy, opposition MKs warned in a Knesset Finance Committee session on Tuesday.\n\nThe budget deficit is the difference between the government\u2019s expenses and its income or assets and occurs when a country\u2019s spending exceeds its income. The updated 2024 budget that passed into law in March set the budget deficit ceiling at 6.6%, but by the end of April already reached 7%. Committee chairman MK Moshe Gafni (United Torah Judaism) held the session after nine committee members, all from the opposition, demanded he address the issue.\n\nYesh Atid MK Vladimir Beliak, the coordinator of the opposition in the committee, pointed out at the beginning of the session that he had warned during the budget debates in March of this scenario, and criticized the government for rejecting steps to decrease its expenditures, such as closing down ministries or reducing the amount of \u201ccoalition funds\u201d which Beliak claimed were reserved for political purposes.\n\n\u201cI want to know, what deficit will we reach? I have not heard from the finance minister [Bezalel Smotrich] \u2026 If we arrive at a double-digit deficit, what will the repercussions be vis-\u00e0-vis the credit rating companies? What will the repercussions be on the social services that the state can provide?\u201d Beliak said. The deficit applies to the past 12 months, and the representative from the finance ministry\u2019s budget department, Asaf Wexler, argued that the deficit will shrink back to within the 6.6% limit by year\u2019s end. According to Wexler, the sharp increase in the deficit reflected months of intense fighting and economic slowdown. Yesh Atid MK Vladimir Beliak. (credit: Courtesy)\n\nIt also reflected the \u201csituation of very high uncertainty\u201d as to when the fighting will end, and consequently to Israel\u2019s economic performance. Wexler admitted, however, that if a war breaks out in Israel\u2019s north, the finance ministry would likely need to update its deficit forecast.\n\nMKs criticized other aspects of the government's performance\n\nDuring the session, both Beliak and Labor MK Naama Lazimi criticized other aspects of the government\u2019s performance on the economy. These included breaking 2023\u2019s deficit ceiling despite updating the 2023 budget in December; the downgrade of Israel\u2019s credit rating by both S&P and Moodys; the fact that Gafni, who is ultra-Orthodox (haredi), has refused to pass several provisions laid out in the budget to increase government income, to protest the withholding of funds he claims have not been given to the haredi school system; the uptick in the cost of living and inflation remaining high at 2.8%; and other aspects. The result is that ahead of the 2025 budget, the state will either need to reduce its spending, which could affect its ability to provide services; or raise taxes.",

Member associations offer valuable resources such as industry-specific research, professional development opportunities and networking events. These will keep you informed about industry trends and advancements. Many associations also provide certifications and training programs that can enhance your credentials and expertise.\n\n2. Grow your professional network. Start with family, friends and former colleagues. They can provide valuable advice and connections, even if they\u2019re not in finance. Attend professional events, conferences and alumni meet-ups. Building relationships with co-workers, managers and industry leaders can open doors to new opportunities. Use platforms such as LinkedIn to connect with professionals in your field. Join finance-related groups and actively participate in discussions.\n\n3. Demonstrate initiative and work ethic. Volunteer for challenging assignments and take the lead on projects. Seeking advancement opportunities shows your willingness to go above and beyond. Engage in leadership development programs offered by your employer or professional association. Showcase your value by consistently delivering high-quality work and demonstrating your tenacity. This will help you stand out from your peers.\n\nJob hunting:How do I approach a former boss or co-worker for a job reference? Ask HR\n\n4. Commit to continuous learning. Learning doesn\u2019t end with formal education. Industries like finance constantly evolve, so staying informed is at least as important as getting your initial degree. Read industry magazines, subscribe to finance newsletters and follow reputable financial news sources. Commit to your professional development. Attend seminars, workshops and conferences to keep your skills and knowledge up to date. To enhance your qualifications, consider pursuing an advanced degree or professional certification such as CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) or CPA (Certified Public Accountant).\n\n5. Develop power skills. While some call them soft skills, I call them power skills, as they can augment your technical acumen and tremendously enhance your ability to work with others. Strong communication and teamwork are crucial in finance. Work on effectively conveying complex information and collaborating with diverse teams. Cultivate your ability to analyze data and solve problems creatively. These skills are highly valued in your industry.\n\n6. Seek mentorship. Look for experienced professionals who can provide guidance, support and insights into the finance industry. Constructive feedback from mentors and peers can help you identify areas for improvement and growth.\n\n7. Set career goals. Define clear short-term and long-term career goals. This will help you stay focused and motivated. Periodically reassess your goals and adjust them as needed to align with your evolving interests and the changing landscape of the finance industry.\n\nI\u2019ll add one more suggestion: Keep your options open. As you move through your career, you\u2019ll likely develop expertise in certain areas. Be willing to look at how your expertise can be applied in other areas. Discover how your experiences can complement and add value to other disciplines and fields. So, don\u2019t get stuck in a siloed mentality. Explore ways finance can broadly enhance other business functions, industries and sectors. Doing so will build flexibility in your career and expand your options for growth.\n\nBy employing these strategies, you can position yourself for success and growth in your finance career. Best of luck on your journey!\n\nCareer change?What should I consider when weighing a new career?",

      "title": "Managing finances after 80: Answers to three major personal finance questions for super senior citizens",
      "news": "He is a retired bureaucrat and has travelled the world on work assignments with his family. Always in charge of his work, life and finances, decision-making has come easily to him. However, at 82, he finds making big decisions somewhat daunting. There are three major personal finance questions to address for a super senior person like him. First, how to ensure that the wealth acquired and cared for over a lifetime is made available to heirs . Second, how to balance the need for financial freedom with dependence on children during one\u2019s lifetime. Third, how to provide for the care and comfort of the surviving spouse when one has passed away.The first question has been answered in an earlier column. Simplifying one\u2019s finances is always a good policy in retirement , especially if one crosses the age of 80. There\u2019s nothing sacrosanct about this number in this day and age, but simplification helps both the investor and his heirs. The first step is to complete any pending asset-related processes. Verify and update nominations, check and organise title deeds, consolidate multiple accounts and folios, close dormant accounts , dematerialise paper shares, and review joint holdings for proper operation.The second important step in estate planning for the elderly is making assets accessible to heirs. Many investors leave their children unaware of their assets, causing confusion after they pass away. Consolidate assets and record details, including e-mail and Internet banking access , in a notebook or spreadsheet for easy reference. With advancing age, either trust heirs with account details or ensure they can easily access them after one\u2019s passing.The third step in accessibility is to liquidate assets that are cumbersome to deal with after the investor has passed. Land, property, jewels and such physical assets are tough to access and use, or liquidate if the heirs are residents in another country. Financial assets are relatively easier to operate and transfer.It is important to consult professionals to understand how laws regarding gifts, estates and taxes apply to heirs. While my friend wants to clean up and consolidate all his financial assets and keep them in a few mutual fund folios and bank accounts, he is not sure how he wants to deal with the two residential properties. Since his son is a resident of a foreign country, if he decides to sell these, he must ensure repatriation of he funds and leverage tax credits for payments made in India.Balancing financial freedom and dependence is challenging. Many modern parents prefer independent living after retirement, relying on pensions, savings and investments. Well-off children are usually willing to cover large expenses, and in amicable relationships, some dependence for emergencies is not frowned upon.Things begin to change with advancing age. The confidence about managing independently takes a hit when when one parent falls ill or suffers a fall. Dependence is often scary for children living far away. Not everyone has a circle of friends or extended family, and even if they do, one is not sure how long others may be able to help ageing and unwell elders. Children arrange caregivers, work with agencies that offer such services for food, physiotherapy and other routine care, ask parents to move into assisted living, or to move in with them.These choices directly impact the sense of independence of the elderly. They are most reluctant to leave the house they have lived in and move elsewhere, even if they understand the benefits of doing so. Depending on the nature of their relationship with their children, choosing to be with them or in assisted living facilities is more practical than being alone.Children who truly care for their parents\u2014 and this tribe is constantly on the rise \u2014would not like them to be alone. My friend understands that he would leave his son anxious and worried if he and his wife lived alone in India. However, winding up everything and moving seems like too much change for their age. It is important to negotiate with children the choices for living in old age and meet in the middle. Living with children works if the parents are comfortable in a new place and have the space and privacy they desire. If it seems like a choice that closes other options, and offers too little by way of interaction and community living, assisted living might work. Being adamant about living alone is a problem many elders and their children grapple with these days.The third question is about caring for the spouse. As one ages, one realises that the couple won\u2019t leave the world together. In the classic mold, the husband worries about the wife\u2019s ability to manage money and the wife worries about the husband\u2019s ability to manage food and health without the other. I would propose that the years in retirement be spent in acquiring these skills rather than ringing one\u2019s hand in despair. Neither cooking, nor investing is rocket science, and it is never too late to learn life skills and be in charge.If this does not appeal to the other, there is no choice but to involve children and their families to assign responsibility and to provide for allocations from the estate to keep the other financially stable. As a rule, assets should vest with the surviving spouse and pass on to heirs only after the spouse\u2019s passing. Keeping assets simple, clean and accessible to begin with helps this cause the most. There is no cure for victimhood and helplessness. Structuring the assets to provide a stable income to spouse is also a good choice to provide them with a sense of empowerment and liquidity, even if they are well taken care of by children.To summarise for my senior friend, it is advisable is to keep a target of 6-12 months to consolidate and simplify assets. Address each asset individually, involve professionals to sell assets, transfer funds, and create a will. Use this time to educate the spouse about operating the bank and investment accounts, and inform the children about the assets. It is never too early to simplify one\u2019s finances.(The author IS CHAIRPERSON, CENTRE FOR INVESTMENT EDUCATION AND LEARNING",

      "title": "A shady financial tool from the housing-bubble era is making a comeback",
      "news": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nAmerica\u2019s gummed-up housing market is a $45 trillion mess \u2014 a big old knot of economic forces smashing into a century\u2019s worth of cultural conditioning about the value of homeownership.\n\nThere are some obvious, urgent needs: We need more housing, full stop. And that housing needs to be affordable. And we should probably stop letting Wall Street firms become landlords for the sole purpose of extracting capital from renters who could otherwise build equity.\n\nPoint is, policymakers aren\u2019t running out of puzzles to solve when it comes to housing. Perhaps the last thing the market needs is another shady financial product that pushes low-income Americans into homes they can\u2019t afford, under terms that could bankrupt them.\n\nAnd yet, here we are. The zero-down mortgage is making a comeback, my colleague Matt Egan reports.\n\nTwo weeks ago, one of the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lenders rolled out a \u201cnew\u201d program (I put new in quotation marks because, well, we\u2019ve seen this movie before) that allow first-time homebuyers to secure their purchase with no money down.\n\nZero down. Lots on the line\n\nLet\u2019s briefly get into how it works, and then we can talk about why it\u2019s a huge red flag for anyone with passing understanding of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nSo, you want to buy a home but you\u2019re not sitting on enough savings for a downpayment. (Super common, totally fine, we\u2019ve all been there.)\n\nUnder the deal being peddled by United Wholesale Mortgage, you can bypass that initial cash payment. (Sounds great, right? Read on.)\n\nInstead, you borrow 3% of the home\u2019s value (up to $15,000) as an interest-free loan, and pay for 97% of the home\u2019s value with a standard mortgage.\n\n(Interest-free! Where do I sign up?)\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: That $15,000 won\u2019t accrue interest, but it will need to be paid back \u2014 in full, all at once \u2014 when you either sell the home, pay off the mortgage or refinance.\n\nThat will work out great, assuming nothing bad happens to you or the economy and the value of your home keeps going up. And honestly, when has the value of the housing market ever gone anywhere but up up up up?\n\nOhhhh right.\n\nSo let\u2019s just highlight some of the ways this $15,000 sword of Damocles could wind up stabbing you in the back.\n\nThe housing market, as we all remember from \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d does not always go up. And because you didn\u2019t put money down, you\u2019d be instantly underwater \u2014 owing more than the home is worth \u2014 if the market sours.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be underwater when tragedy strikes. Losing a job or falling into financial distress might prompt you to try to sell your house, which would put you on the hook to pay back the $15,000. But if the house isn\u2019t worth what you owe, you\u2019ll be in default. That scenario is \u201cexactly what happened during the subprime crisis,\u201d said Patricia McCoy, a professor at Boston College Law School. \u201cIt happened before and it could happen again.\u201d\n\nEven under the rosiest economic scenario, you still have to pony up $15,000 at some point. And as any homeowner can attest, your house is going to be a constant financial drain from the moment you\u2019re handed the keys. You are going to have projects. Lots and lots of projects. And they won\u2019t always be the fun DIY bathroom renos you see on TikTok. Most of them will be the \u201choly crap we have to replace the entire roof before the winter\u201d kinda projects. That\u2019s going to slow your cash accumulation significantly.\n\nUWM is pushing back on all those concerns, noting that borrowers must still go through strict underwriting guidelines, and lending standards have gone up significantly since the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cPeople who make these claims are uneducated about the current state of the industry,\u201d Alex Elezaj, UWM\u2019s chief strategy officer, told CNN. \u201cIn today\u2019s environment, UWM is responsible for underwriting the loan, which gives us confidence that these are high quality loans.\u201d\n\nAnd sure, we\u2019re not exactly doling out NINJA loans \u2014 no income, no job or assets \u2014 anymore.\n\nBut if there\u2019s a morsel of wisdom mortgage companies should have tattooed on their foreheads it\u2019s that lower-income people with no savings are likely to suffer more in a bad economy.\n\n\u201cOne of the lessons of the subprime crisis,\u201d said Jonathan Adams, an assistant professor at Saint Joseph\u2019s University, \u201cwas that you are not doing any favors to borrowers by making it too easy to borrow.\u201d\n\nCreative homebuying\n\nThe resurgence of the zero-down loan underscores how sticky the housing market of 2024 has become. With low inventory and mortgage rates around 7%, sellers are unmotivated to move, and buyers lack choice, forcing some to get creative.\n\nOne way for motivated buyers to hunt for a lower mortgage rate is buy someone else\u2019s. \u201cAssumable\u201d mortgages are loans that allow a homebuyer to take over a seller\u2019s existing loan \u2014 its (ideally) lower interest rate, my colleague Samantha Delouya reports.\n\nThe way it works: A buyer pays out in cash the amount that the seller has in equity, while taking on the remaining mortgage balance.\n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect solution for everyone, of course \u2014 that equity could be a hefty amount that the buyer may not have on hand, and only about a quarter of all mortgages is the US are assumable. But it beats waiting on the magic combination of macroeconomic forces to finally bring rates on new mortgages down.\n\nIt worked for Ellen Harper, a software analyst in her mid-50s, who closed on a Fairburn, Georgia, home in April, when the average 30-year rate was just over 7%. Harper\u2019s rate? 2.49%. That\u2019s saving her thousands of dollars in monthly payments, Samantha writes.\n\n\u201cI just decided I wanted to see how low I could pay on the interest rate,\u201d Harper says. \u201cI went into it looking for the best deal I could get, and I think I did pretty good.\u201d",

      "news": "Job openings fell in April to their lowest level since February 2021 as the labor market shows further signs of cooling off from the hiring boom that followed the US economy reopening after the pandemic.\n\nNew data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 8.06 million jobs open at the end of April, a decrease from the 8.35 million job openings in March.\n\nMarch's figure was revised lower from the 8.48 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected the report to show 8.35 million openings in April.\n\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.6 million hires were made during the month, little changed from March.\n\nThe hiring rate held at 3.6%, unchanged from March. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, held steady at 2.2%.\n\n\"The decline in openings points to a slower pace of hiring in the months ahead. However, layoffs remain low, so net job growth should continue to be positive,\" Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note following Tuesday's release.\n\nInvestors have closely watched the JOLTS report, along with other key labor market data, for signs that cooling labor demand could help inflation pressures ease, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to begin lowering interest rates from 23-year highs.\n\nVanden Houten noted that the Fed will welcome signs of cooler labor market conditions from the latest JOLTS report, but the central bank likely needs to see further evidence of inflation falling before cutting rates.\n\nRead more: How does the labor market affect inflation?\n\n\"The labor market remains healthy enough to allow Fed policy decisions to be primarily guided by readings on inflation,\" Vanden Houten wrote.\n\nThe report kicks off a busy week for labor market data, which will also include updates on private sector hiring and wage growth from ADP on Wednesday, jobless claims on Thursday, and the May jobs report on Friday.\n\nThe May jobs report is expected to show 185,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month with unemployment holding steady at 3.9%, according to data from Bloomberg.\n\nIn April, the US economy added 175,000 jobs while the unemployment rate ticked up by 0.1% to 3.9%.\n\nA 'Now Hiring' sign posted on the window of a business looking to hire workers on May 5, 2023, in Miami, Fla.

      "title": "AI is on track to \u2018democratize financial planning.\u2019 Are investors ready for that?",
      "news": "From creative professions to the tech sector, AI is shaking up industries and daily workflows. And it\u2019s coming for the financial services industry next\u2014whether investors are ready or not.\n\nA new report from Deloitte Center for Financial Services posits that generative AI-enabled applications could become the leading source of advice for retail investors by 2027. It\u2019s already being used by financial companies to power customer-facing chatbots, prevent fraud, and speed up other tasks like coding. But Deloitte\u2019s analysts say it will soon take a much larger role in helping customers fine-tune investment plans.\n\n\u201cInvestment advice through gen AI could be easily accessible to investors in the next few years as financial institutions roll out revamped advice engines powered by gen AI,\u201d Deloitte\u2019s report reads. \u201cIt is likely that investors will start to expect gen AI-powered investment tools.\u201d\n\nThough Deloitte\u2019s report deems AI-powered financial advice an inevitability, other research finds that many investors themselves aren\u2019t on board\u2014at least not yet. Most Americans report being skeptical of the potential of AI when it comes to their personal finances, according to data released Tuesday from Northwestern Mutual\u2019s 2024 Planning & Progress Study, which surveyed almost 4,600 American adults earlier this year on a variety of financial topics.\n\nThat said, there are some early signs of optimism. Perhaps unsurprisingly, younger Americans are less skeptical of using AI to achieve financial goals than older Americans. While only 41% of all adults say they\u2019re excited about the potential of AI in the financial industry, that includes 57% of Gen Zers and 55% of millennials.\n\nExactly what kind of financial tasks they trust AI to perform is the bigger question, but \u201chelping with a budget\u201d received the largest amount of support from those surveyed, while \u201ccreating a retirement plan\u201d received the least. That tracks with how the company envisions AI will start being used in peoples\u2019 finances, says Christian Mitchell, executive vice president and chief customer officer at Northwestern Mutual: by replacing the more mundane tasks of financial planners, like responding to clients or summarizing market trends, allowing them more time to focus on clients.\n\nConsumers are right to be wary. While the potential of AI is extolled by industry players and many companies are pushing full-steam ahead with incorporating the technology into their products, there are still some kinks to work out. And at a basic level, people still want to talk to other people, especially when it comes to their long-term financial goals and the complications and nuances that are inherent to them.\n\nBut even in these early stages, the technology \"could be a really interesting accountability buddy,\" says Mitchell, noting that AI could be used to analyze spending and investing patterns to provide real-time feedback to investors. It could also be used to help clients visualize what their deferred gratification\u2014all that saving in a retirement fund or brokerage account\u2014could get them, like, say, a vacation home.\n\n\"Gen AI will be able to render things in real time,\" Mitchell says. \"It can take something distant and make it feel immediate.\" And research has shown this type of visualization helps encourage people save more.\n\nFor its part, Northwestern Mutual has already begun incorporating AI into some of its workflows, Mitchell says. It is being used by its engineering teams as well as customer relations representatives to expedite finding policy information.\n\nAnd Mitchell says human advisors, particularly younger ones, are curious about incorporating AI into their own workflows. While Deloitte's report notes that the percentage of retail investors using advisors will drop slightly as AI becomes more commonly used, advisors themselves could use it to make time to see additional clients.\n\nThat's how Mitchell foresees AI's immediate impact in the space: \"It will democratize financial planning.\"",

      "title": "Amherst finance board backs finding money to give regional schools 6% boost",
      "news": "AMHERST \u2014 The town Finance Committee is unanimously recommending that the town support a 6% increase in the fiscal year 2025 assessment for the Amherst Pelham Regional schools, with the needed money to support the adjustment coming from either free cash or American Rescue Plan Act money.\n\nThe five members of the Town Council who serve on the Finance Committee, joined by community member Bernie Kubiak, voted 5-0 at a meeting last Friday to endorse increasing the town\u2019s assessment by an additional $355,440, leading to an $18.8 million assessment that will go toward a $35.27 million budget.\n\nThe recommendation leaves the exact source for the extra money uncertain. Still, the vote provides information to Town Manager Paul Bockelman so he can prepare a financial order for the added money, after recently advising that town officials could divert a portion of $1 million in ARPA money set aside to pay for a solar canopy at the new elementary school being built at the Fort River School site on South East Street.\n\nDistrict 1 Councilor Cathy Schoen made the original motion to ask the town manager to add 2% to the regional budget, with the additional expense to be funded through free cash. Schoen said she anticipates that the town will have additional free cash when spending in the capital plan budget comes in below projections.\n\nSchoen agreed to amend the motion due to concerns about how using free cash would impact municipal reserves.\n\nThe extra money is needed because the budget Bockelman presented on May 1 includes only a 4% increase for the regional schools, abiding by the guidelines set by the Town Council. This is the first time since Town Council was seated in December 2018 that it may amend the town manager\u2019s budget recommendation, which it can do by a vote to override or by making cuts elsewhere in the budget.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s uncharted territory for the town,\u201d Bockelman said.\n\nWithout a supplemental financial order from Bockelman, there are concerns that it would be time-consuming to get the budget through the override or cuts, which could lead to not having a budget for the regional schools on July 1. Under that scenario, a budget in effect would be one-twelfth of the previous year\u2019s budget, putting the schools into possible disarray after the fiscal year 2025 budget was already supported by Town Meeting votes in Leverett, Pelham and Shutesbury.\n\nKubiak said his preference is to take money from ARPA, since it wouldn\u2019t affect reserves, but using free cash is also an acceptable and likely more economical approach. He said it makes more sense than trying to override the town manager\u2019s budget.\n\nAt Large Councilor Andy Steinberg said he would have preferred to delay a recommendation until quarterly financial reports are finalized. \u201cI don\u2019t see there\u2019s any advantage in taking the vote now,\u201d Steinberg said.\n\nDistrict 5 Councilor Bob Hegner, who chairs the Finance Committee, said councilors are torn as to where the extra money will come from, but do want the higher regional budget.\n\nAt Large Councilor Mandi Jo Hanneke appeared to favor using ARPA money, though she questioned which projects it would be diverted from.\n\nScott Merzbach can be reached at smerzbach@gazettenet.com.",

      "title": "Greenwashing in the EU financial markets: sustainable finance status update",
      "news": "Greenwashing in the financial markets generally\n\nOn 4 June 2024, the EU authorities for the banking and insurance sectors and the securities markets EBA, EIOPA and ESMA considered the concept of \u2018greenwashing\u2019 in the financial markets against a background of concerns that financial products, such as loans, bonds, investments and insurance, were all too easily promoted as \u2018ESG\u2019 or \u2018sustainable\u2019. In their respective final reports, the ESAs published their common high-level understanding of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d as a practice whereby sustainability-related statements, declarations, actions, or communications do not clearly and fairly reflect the underlying sustainability profile of an entity, a financial product, or financial services. The European authorities stress that financial market players have a responsibility to provide sustainability information that is fair, clear, and not misleading. See the final reports here.\n\nFunds and investments\n\nFor fund managers and financial advisers, the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) sets out requirements for disclosure of information and investment objectives to investors regarding the promotion of financial products with environmental or social characteristics (Article 8 - Products) or with sustainable investment as their objective (Article 9 - Products). For example, according to the SFDR, a sustainable investment is an \"investment that contributes to an environmental or social objective, as measured by key indicators or a reference benchmark; does not significantly harm any of the environmental or social objectives; ensures that the investee companies follow good governance practices, such as respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery measures, and sound management structures.\" For further information on this subject, see this article.\n\nIn addition to disclosure requirements applying to the activities and performance of such Article 8 or Article 9 funds, asset managers of regulated investment funds under UCITS and alternative investment funds under AIFMD must also be careful with the naming of such funds. On 14 May 2024, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published Guidelines (click) on funds\u2019 names using ESG or sustainability-related terms.\n\nESMA distinguishes 3 levels of recommendations for funds names:\n\nall funds with names that include terms related to green, social, governance, transition, impact, ESG, SRI and other environmental, impact, sustainability-related terms: should invest at least 80% in investments that meet environmental or social characteristics or sustainable investment objectives as set out under SFDR; and should apply the CTB exclusion criteria under BMR; funds with names that include environmental, impact or sustainability-related terms should apply also the PAB exclusion criteria under BMR; and funds with names that include sustainability-related terms should commit to invest meaningfully in \u201csustainable investments\u201d as defined under SFDR.\n\nThe guidelines published by the ESMA will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the ESMA website. After the publication, national competent authorities must notify ESMA within two months whether or not they comply with the Guidelines.\n\nBenchmarks\n\nFor climate benchmarks, the EU Benchmark Regulation (BMR) sets out the basis on which benchmark administrators may classify benchmarks, such as indices, as Climate Transition Benchmarks (CTBs) or EU Paris-Aligned Benchmarks (PABs). Essentially, BMR prescribes both (A) exclusion criteria for CTBs (exclusion of controversial weapons, tobacco, and violators of UNGC principles and OECD MNE Guidelines) and additional exclusion criteria for PABs (additional exclusion of companies involved in certain hard coal, lignite, oil & gas and GHG intense emission) and (B) disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions of the underlying assets and the relevant methodology.\n\nBonds\n\nEffective December 2024, bonds issued in the EU may be designated and labelled as \u2018EU green bonds\u2019 if they meet the requirements of the EU Green Bond Regulation (GBR), which also includes provisions relating to \u2018sustainability linked\u2019 bonds. For more information on the GBR, see this article.\n\nImplications for financial markets\n\nIn view of the recent and expected developments on greenwashing for financial products, and taking into account upcoming review of UCITS and AIFMD, financial market participants should consider whether to update product disclosure, marketing materials, pre- and post-contractual information, prospectuses and other disclosures in relation to any ESG and sustainability related products, as well as to update internal processes, training and monitoring of client preferences in this area.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the above, please contact Marieke Driessen of our Stibbe Financial Markets team.",

      "title": "The stock market took a narrow road to record highs last month",
      "news": "The broadening of the stock market rally fell by the wayside as the index reached record levels last month.\n\nJust six large tech stocks contributed to more than 75% of the S&P 500's gain in May, a move reminiscent of how the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks drove the market rally in 2023.\n\nRises in Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) shares helped the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to its best May since 2003.\n\n\"We're seeing a relatively narrow market, and that narrowness has been increasing recently and really driven by fewer stocks,\" BMO Wealth Management US chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma told Yahoo Finance. \"That's not what you want to see for market health.\"\n\nParticipation from the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 had been a feature of runs toward record highs in the last six months, including in late 2023 and near the end of the first quarter. In May, the S&P 500 rose about 4%, while the equal-weighted index was up less than 2%. In the first quarter of the year, the spread between these two indexes was closer to 0.5%.\n\nBut since stocks bottomed out after a 5% pullback in the S&P 500 that ended in mid-April, the market has once again been all about Big Tech.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) posted its best May in over 20 years, led by nearly a 30% jump in Nvidia stock over the past month.\n\nBank of America investment strategist Michael Hartnett noted the relative price performance of the equal-weighted S&P 500 (^SPXEW) against the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 is at its worst level since March 2009 after a rebound last year.\n\nThis narrow leadership has seen breadth \u2014 or the number of stocks advancing minus the number of stocks declining \u2014 fall toward the low end of its historical range.\n\nData from Bespoke Investment Group published last Thursday showed breadth over the previous 10 trading days had fallen to the lowest decile of performance going back to 2002, meaning that over 90% of the time, the market sees more stocks participating in gains than what predominated in late May.\n\nThe firm did note, however, that breadth at these levels often portends the strongest returns of any decile over the following three-, six-, and 12-month periods.\n\nNed Davis Research chief US strategist Ed Clissold wrote in a note to clients that \"several market breadth indicators\" haven't followed the recent rally higher.\n\nThis could be a point of concern if the narrow leadership from Big Tech over the last month falls off. According to Clissold, this sometimes happens when market rallies peak.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The bottom line is that while some divergences have been developing all year, most only presented themselves in recent weeks,\" Clissold wrote. \"If the market is in a topping process, it is likely in the beginning phases. Not enough evidence has changed to warrant adjusting our overweight recommendation to US stocks.\"\n\nNvidia logo is seen during Impact'24 congress in Poznan, Poland on May 16, 2024. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nIn a note to clients on Monday, RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina called this recent action a \"sudden stall\" in the rotation trade, citing a few catalysts giving investors reason for concern.\n\nA rise in Treasury yields has once again become a headwind for stocks, pushing many investors to lean on large-cap stocks. This also comes as the fundamental story has been most impressive for that group as well, with earnings being revised higher for large-cap tech stocks in recent weeks, Calvasina noted.\n\nThese shifts have happened as the story of a resilient US economy that could grow more than expected this year has been taking hits.\n\nA reading on first quarter economic growth was revised lower during the last week of May, while the latest look at manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management showed activity fell further into contraction last month.\n\nAnd in describing what could revive the rotation trade, Calvasina wrote: \"Our work suggests that the 10-year yield (^TNX) needs to stop rising, the market needs more clarity and certainty around the path of monetary policy and the timing of cuts, earnings trends need to improve for the broader market such that they look better than the biggest growth names, and economic excitement needs to return.\"\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "news": "(Reuters) -Short seller Hindenburg Research on Tuesday took a short position in digital bank Axos Financial, alleging lax underwriting standards and glaring issues with its loan portfolio, sending shares down more than 7%.\n\nHindenburg, a forensic financial research firm, said the bank was exposed to the riskiest asset classes, and had increased its total exposure to the deteriorating commercial real estate (CRE) market, while its peers backed away from the sector.\n\nThe bank's exposure to CRE was at $9.9 billion at the end of March, compared with $5.5 billion three years earlier, Hindenburg said.\n\nAxos' customer base in the commercial and multifamily segments comprised \"borrowers who couldn't get loans from other banks,\" which has resulted in problem loans for the bank, the short seller said in its report.\n\nHindenburg said the bank's price/tangible book value was 35% above the multiple of its peers.\n\nCalifornia-based Axos Financial did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nShares of the bank, whose borrowers include former U.S. President Donald Trump, are down about 11% so far this year.\n\nAxos is the tenth-most shorted regional bank, according to S3 Partners. Short interest in Axos totals $319 million, or 11.84% of its free float.\n\nAccording to a public financial disclosure report filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics last year, Trump has two outstanding mortgages worth over $100 million with Axos Bank.\n\nThe two 10-year mortgages enabled Trump to finance the Trump Tower and the Trump National Doral golf course in Miami, the filing showed. They were issued in 2022 at 4.25% and 4.9%, respectively.\n\nHindenburg is best known for placing bets against companies that have been connected with allegations of wrongdoing. It was founded in 2017 by Nathan Anderson.\n\nAmong its high-profile bets was a short position in electric truck maker Nikola in September 2020. The company's founder, Trevor Milton, was sentenced last year to four years in prison after a jury found him guilty of fraud.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the claims in the report about Axos.\n\nThe CRE market, impacted by elevated interest rates and lower occupancy, has been a cause of concern for banking investors, after New York Community Bancorp's recent turmoil.\n\nNYCB posted a surprise quarterly loss in January and slashed its dividend, due to exposure to commercial real estate, and wiped billions off its market value.\n\nLast month, Starwood Real Estate Income Trust also temporarily limited share redemptions to avoid forced sales of its real estate holdings.\n\n(Reporting by Arasu Kannagi Basil and Pritam Biswas in Bengaluru and Koh Qui Ging and Carolina Mandl in New YorkEditing by Shinjini Ganguli and Matthew Lewis)",

      "news": "Climate First Bank\n\nClimate First Bank reaches three years as an established bank with the FDIC, allowing it to exit regulatory de novo status and scale operations outside Florida\n\nORLANDO, Fla., June 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Climate First Bank , the world\u2019s first FDIC-insured bank founded to combat the climate crisis, today announces its exit from regulatory de novo status, following its three-year anniversary in operation. This major milestone marks a new chapter for the bank as it begins preparations to expand nationwide and fully execute its mission to make sustainable banking accessible to all.\n\nClimate First Bank, having seen unprecedented success since its inception, has fulfilled all requirements necessary to exit de novo status, a period of heightened regulatory oversight for start-up banks. Since 2021, the bank has demonstrated its ability to achieve sustainable growth, expand its products and services, and reach consistent profitability.\n\n\u201cOur foundation is, and always will remain rooted as a values-based bank that puts its customers and the environment first,\u201d said Ken LaRoe, Founder and CEO of Climate First Bank. \u201cWe are thrilled to have fulfilled the necessary requirements to reach this monumental achievement, as it allows us to continue our momentum and expand our footprint nationwide. This opens doors to so many new opportunities and possibilities, including setting a national standard for community-first sustainable finance.\u201d\n\nThe bank\u2019s core mission is to enable customers to use their finances as a force for good.

As the bank exits de novo and expands across the United States, it will enable customers nationwide to access the full portfolio of sustainable banking products and services. A key part of the bank\u2019s portfolio of products are its accessible, transparent, and affordable consumer and commercial solar loans, designed to bring solar to everyone regardless of income, location or background.

As the bank exits de novo, it plans to continue to grow its Florida footprint with branches in Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville. The digital branch will continue to enhance its services and usability for customers across the nation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bank recently surpassed $650 million in assets and earlier this quarter achieved SBA preferred lender status. This steady cadence of milestones has set the foundation for Climate First Bank\u2019s impressive viability within just three years of operation. To accommodate increasing customer demands and to build out offered services, the bank has onboarded several new employees including Maria Castillo as Marketing Associate, Rob Perry as AVP, Assistant Branch Manager and Samantha Gonzalez as Business Operations Manager for the bank\u2019s fintech affiliate, OneEthos.\n\n\u201cClimate First Bank\u2019s success as a de novo bank demonstrates the potential of values-based banks not just in the state of Florida but across the United States,\u201d said Chris Cucci, SVP, Chief of Staff at Climate First Bank.\n\nClimate First Bank serves personal and business banking customers nationwide.

      "title": "CMOs - want to reach peak financial performance all year round? Then partner with finance!",
      "news": "(\u00a9 peshkov - Canva.com)\n\nIt never fails \u2013 you finish your annual corporate planning cycle and, a few short months later, you are scrambling to determine if you\u2019re ahead or behind marketing goal attainment. Your CEO is asking questions, the CFO is inquiring about ROI, and your sales counterpart is, as always, looking for more, and more qualified pipeline.\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar story for most marketers, yet it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. All you need is a marketing plan that\u2019s integrated with the tools you already use so you can gain real-time insights and put untapped marketing capabilities to work. A little AI wouldn\u2019t hurt, either.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned in my role as CMO on ways you can get and stay ahead of your marketing goals this year and every year.\n\nMarketing must look ahead, not behind, to plot the best course forward\n\nMarketing teams typically gather at the end of the month and quarter to review performance. There's a lot of talk about cost-per-leads, lifetime values, click-through rates, conversion rates, qualified lead ratios, and more. You can see where you\u2019ve done well and not-so-well, and the budget you\u2019ve thrown at over- and underperforming campaigns for the past 30 or 90 days.\n\nIt would have been helpful to see budget utilization weeks ago. But, you can reallocate your marketing spend next month, right?\n\nTo finance teams, marketing performance is just a cryptic puzzle. That CTR/MQL/etc. alphabet soup means little; they just want you to prove how your budget is turning into revenue and profits. Same with sales. 'Show me the money,' as they say.\n\nThe challenge with the marketing status quo is that marketers tend to work in hindsight. I know because as a marketing leader, I\u2019ve been there, working in spreadsheets, unable to easily see an accurate and near-real-time view of where all the spend sits. Then it\u2019s a scramble at the end of the month to gather metrics, assemble them into a high-level spreadsheet, and do your best to explain it to Finance. Thirty days later, rinse and repeat.\n\nQuantify marketing value in terms that your CFO understands\n\nMarketing budgets are a mixed bag for 2024. A recent survey by MarketingProfs found that 48% of B2B marketers expect budget increases this year, 27% expect decreases, and 25% expect their budgets to remain unchanged. Another survey found that CFOs usually understand the 'you gotta spend money to make money' adage, but of course, they aren\u2019t happy wasting money. If there\u2019s any role that thrives on numbers over gut feeling, it\u2019s the CFO.\n\nFor marketing, this means two distinct things:\n\nSpeak in the language of finance, not marketing. Prove the value of marketing in business terms.\n\nThis matters because you have to show Finance that you\u2019re spending marketing dollars wisely in just a few minutes. Finance doesn\u2019t care about CTRs and MQLs, but they do know one acronym very well \u2013 ROI.\n\nArticulating marketing progress, spend, budget needs, and return in dollars is how you engage with Finance. Using that language to then show how marketing spend is resulting in business outcomes is how you get Finance to invest more in Marketing\u2019s efforts.\n\nConnecting finance and marketing insights\n\nCvent, an industry-leading meetings, events, and hospitality technology provider, experienced the challenges that came with disconnected marketing and finance data. The company managed its budget in over 50 disconnected, offline spreadsheets, which hampered access to real-time data and reduced their ability to forecast and monitor marketing expenses accurately.\n\nCvent\u2019s marketing team partnered with Planful to centralize spend management and gain visibility into budgets, track progress toward goals, and identify potential areas of overspending. This allows the team to quickly access up-to-date information, empowering them to make well-informed decisions rooted in real-time insights. Christine Kelly, Manager of Marketing Technology and Automation at Cvent, says:\n\nBy operationalizing our marketing plan, we have set the foundation to measure ROI and prove the value of marketing via data. We have increased efficiency in forecasting a large complex budget every month. Now budget managers can easily forecast based on real-time data.\n\nBetter marketing outcomes run through finance\n\nThe best CMOs build a business case that CFOs and CEOs will buy, they collaborate and communicate frequently, clearly, and in the language of business, not marketing. And when the C-suite can clearly understand the CMO\u2019s business case, and it\u2019s articulated in business terms, it removes all the friction in the conversation.\n\nWhen you speak in the language of finance, it\u2019s easy to get the CFO on board and together, explore a new world of planning possibilities. You can partner with finance on strategic direction, show them how you\u2019re repurposing spend to higher impact and higher ROI programs, and prove \u2014 in dollars \u2014 the value marketing brings to the business.",

      "title": "EU finance ministers to discuss leveraging Russian assets on Wednesday",
      "news": "By Jan Strupczewski\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers will hold a videoconference on Wednesday on a G7 proposal to leverage Russian central bank assets immobilised in the West to allow Kyiv swiftly to receive a loan of around $50 billion, senior euro zone officials said.\n\nThe size of the loan has not yet been agreed in the EU, the officials said, but the $50 billion was mentioned by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as a possible amount after a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers on 23-25 May in Italy.\n\nThe idea is that the money for Ukraine, struggling to buy weapons to fend off the Russian invasion, would be raised through a bond that could be backed by annual windfall profits generated by the $300 billion of Russian central bank assets frozen in the West after Moscow's attack on Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nEuropean officials have said that, while seizing the capital of the assets would be legally very risky, using the profits generated by the frozen capital is fine because the profits do not legally belong to Moscow.\n\n\"There is a lot of uncertainty about the potential modalities, but the key issue on the table is whether the EU would be open to some sort of concessional loan to Ukraine, based on future revenue stream from the frozen Russian assets,\" one senior euro zone official said.\n\nEuropean governments have already agreed to transfer profits of 2.5 to 3 billion euros ($2.7-3.3 billion) per year generated by the Russian assets to a special fund that would finance the purchase of weapons and also reconstruction of Ukraine.\n\nIf the EU were to agree to using the profits as a leveraging tool to get more money up front, as proposed by the United States, it would have to amend its decision to spend the cash on weapons and reconstruction.\n\n\"In practice, that would mean changing for 2025 and beyond the recently adopted decision on windfall profits in EU. There would also be potential changes to the EU sanctions regime when it comes to the assets,\" the senior euro zone official said.\n\nOfficials said that another open issue was who would issue the bonds to raise the money: should it be the United States and other G7 countries, or should be it be the EU, which has holds by far the biggest amount of the immobilized assets.\n\nFor the EU to agree to issue the bonds, either alone or as part of a G7 consortium, would likely open a tricky question of joint responsibility for the debt, something that some, like Germany, normally strongly oppose.\n\n\"I do not expect any concrete outcome after the video-teleconference. I see it more like a check of temperature before next week's G7 leaders' summit,\" the senior official said.\n\nLeaders of the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, Germany, France and Italy - the G7 - are set to meet in Italy on June 13-15 and the issue of the Russian assets is on their agenda.\n\n(Reporting by Jan Strupczewski; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)",

      "news": "Students are more optimistic about their career prospects in finance than they are in biology, computer science, engineering, and mathematics \u2014 and the gap is widening.\n\nWhen students were asked which industries (if any) they were feeling most confident about in terms of their career prospects, finance was the clear winner. In a 2024 survey by the CFA Institute, 30 percent of students were confident in a finance degree leading to a good career compared to 20 percent of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees; 19 percent of information technology or telecommunications; 18 percent of sales, media, and marketing; and 17 percent of education.\n\nOnly 9 percent of students with degrees in arts and culture were confident about their future careers; 8 percent were confident in the legal industry; and 6 percent in manufacturing and utilities. Overall, only 3 percent of nearly 10,000 students surveyed said they were not feeling confident about their career prospects.\n\nThe gap between finance and STEM degrees grew 6 percentage points year-over-year, the survey found, and there could be multiple reasons for that. The optimism about finance remains high because it is a big industry and it pays better than others. But other reasons \u2014 like the opportunity to shape the world using the influence of the financial services industry \u2014 appear to be growing stronger.\n\n\u201cAs graduates today seek professions that not only promise stability but also resonate with their desires to make a tangible difference, finance emerges as an industry of opportunity. Our research shows that careers in finance offer the assurance of stability and provide a platform for graduates to contemplate a more impactful future,\u201d Margaret Franklin, president and CEO of the CFA Institute, said in a statement. \u201cWith a new focus on sustainable investment strategies, and the possibilities for AI to enhance investment workflows, graduates have an opportunity to help shape a more innovative industry through a career in finance.\u201d\n\nGraduates felt that their career prospects had improved after getting a degree but they said their resumes had an edge if they had more real-world experience, such as an internship and practical skills.\n\nMost graduates (81 percent) also said they valued post-graduate certifications and qualifications because they were a way to secure higher earnings and gain a competitive edge in the job market. 95 percent say upskilling or acquiring certifications are important, and 71 percent say certifications will have a large impact on their job opportunities.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s graduates desire to attain real-world experience as they increasingly seek opportunities to differentiate themselves in a crowded job market,\u201d Peter Watkins, senior director of university programs at the CFA Institute, said. \u201cOrganizations that continue to invest in upskilling and career advancement opportunities for their employees will be attractive to the next generation, who are keen to grow professionally.\u201d\n\nDespite increased confidence levels in financial services and other industries, students also said their biggest concerns included low pay (11 percent), lack of jobs in their preferred sector (10 percent), and feeling unfulfilled or uninterested in their work (10 percent).\n\nThe survey included respondents who were pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, or earned a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher within the last three years (and were between 18 and 25). Respondents were located in the U.K., U.S., Canada, India, Australia, Singapore, U.A.E., Germany, Spain, France, Brazil, Mexico, and China.",

      "title": "Finance Director Finds Potential $2.6 Million Shortfall For 2025 Insurance",
      "news": "In doing research for an insurance premium increase projected for 2025, new Finance Director Glenys Salas has identified a number of shortfalls in the budget that could lead to a $2.6 million deficit in town and school self-insurance line items.\n\n\u201cThis is the worst case scenario,\u201d Salas qualified the number, saying it could potentially be smaller, at the May 23 Board of Finance meeting.\n\nThe first part of the deficit comes from $1 million budgeted as revenue from the town\u2019s fund balance that is not accounted for as an expense anywhere else in the budget.\n\n\u201cWe will have a $1 million deficit as of June 30, 2024,\u201d said Salas.\n\nSalas said she believed that the deficit came from the budget being \u201csomewhat optimistic\u201d regarding unassigned fund balance revenues, which she said would be closer to $200,000 than $1 million.\n\nOn the revenue side, Salas said she found a shortfall of $500,000.\n\nThe school budget also included a grant of approximately $100,000 that had previously expired, which means a $100,000 shortfall there.\n\nFinally, by looking at the claims to the town\u2019s self-insurance for 2024, she is estimating that expenses will exceed the self-insurance line item by $1 million.\n\nBOF member Barney Molloy noted that in future budgets, this could mean a \u201cseven figure increase\u201d in the insurance line item \u201cno matter how you slice and dice it.\u201d\n\nHowever, the shortfall should not affect the town\u2019s overall budget too negatively; she noted the town is \u201cin a very strong cash position.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in danger of not being able to pay bills,\u201d said Salas.\n\nShe also noted that attempts to put the budget back in line could be a \u201cmulti-year\u201d effort.\n\nSalas said the town could remedy that situation by appropriating the $1 million elsewhere in the budget; however, she said if taken from the fund balance that would put the town below the 12% of total budget target the town set for the fund balance, which is part of the town\u2019s AAA credit rating with S&P Global.\n\nShe recommended that the town and school employees cost share for insurance increase to \u201cbe in line\u201d with the town\u2019s contribution, increasing to 9%.\n\nThe BOF, the Board of Selectmen, and Legislative Council are expected to continue discussion of possible remedies for the shortfall at future meetings.\n\nEditor Jim Taylor can be reached at jim@thebee.com.",

      "title": "The Life and Times of Finance & Development",
      "news": "5 min (1403 words) Read\n\nDownload PDF\n\nFor 60 years, the magazine has been a window into the IMF and the evolving global economy\n\nThe Beatles are all the rage. The US Congress passes the Civil Rights Act. Nelson Mandela is condemned to life in prison in South Africa. Audrey Hepburn stars in My Fair Lady. And in Washington, on a quiet corner of 19th Street, NW, a magazine is born.\n\n\n\nThe debut of Finance & Development (F&D) in June 1964 may not have been as momentous as other events of that year, but it marked the opening of a unique window for the public to peer into the workings\u2014and thinking\u2014of the IMF and the World Bank. Over time, it would also allow the Bank and Fund to see how outsiders view a variety of economic and financial topics critical to their work.\n\nWhen IMF Deputy Managing Director Frank A. Southard Jr. proposed a \u201cless technical periodical\u201d to reach government officials, bankers, journalists, and students he envisioned a Fund-only product (as it later became, when the World Bank dropped out in the 1990s). However, he welcomed World Bank President George Woods\u2019s suggestion for a joint publication, which opened the magazine to a broader range of topics and widened its appeal to readers in the developing world.\n\nThe beginnings\n\nThe early issues of The Fund and Bank Review: Finance & Development set the stage for the rest of the decade, its mission firmly anchored in information for the general reader about the World Bank and the IMF. There were articles on the origins of the two institutions, their financial structures, and operations. Shorter pieces demystified Fund jargon\u2014such as Stand-By Arrangements, balance of payments deficits, and multiple currency practices\u2014and detailed both institutions\u2019 financial transactions and activities.\n\nF&D was not produced in a vacuum. During the 1960s, the developing world, in the throes of decolonization, aspired to catch up to wealthier countries. At the Bank, following the development logic of the time\u2014industrialization leads to growth; growth helps the poor\u2014the emphasis was on project lending for infrastructure and industry. F&D carried numerous articles profiling Bank-funded projects and explaining the practicalities of lending for development.\n\n\n\nSince the first illustrated cover, in March 1968, showcasing Kenyan villagers at a new World Bank\u2013financed water tap, F&D has portrayed successful projects as symbols of modernity and prosperity. The September 1968 cover and its accompanying article highlighted how new irrigation dams were turning a Mexican desert into fertile farmland. Visitors to the 1968 Olympic Games, it promised, could thus expect to dine on produce \u201cgrown by the farmers of this newly prosperous area.\u201d Another piece described the Western Highway in Honduras\u2014financed by the International Development Association\u2019s first loan\u2014as \u201cthe hypodermic needle by which the vaccine of modern life is being injected into the countryside.\u201d\n\nSeveral articles from the late 1960s discussed the intertwined problems of the US balance of payments and global liquidity.\n\nYet by the end of the decade, the paradigm of industrialization-driven development was being challenged. In his 1968 book Asian Drama: An Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations, Nobel Laureate Gunnar Myrdal asserted that \u201cdevelopment is not a mechanical process of adding to capital stock, human skills, technological knowledge and artifices but a matter of institutional change, of attitudes and behavior patterns, of all those intangible elements that distinguish a human society from a field of particles or a colony of ants.\u201d To the World Bank\u2019s economists this was heresy, and in June 1969, F&D published a lengthy rejoinder\u2014not so much questioning Myrdal\u2019s thesis as critiquing his lack of practical solutions.\n\nBy the next year, however, Bank President Robert S. McNamara was calling for development indicators that \u201cgo beyond the measure of growth in total output and provide practical yardsticks\n\nof change in the other economic, social, and moral dimensions of the modernizing process.\u201d\n\nThis was also the heyday of the Bretton Woods system: a 1966 article proudly proclaimed 20 years of fixed exchange rates. But the system was already under strain. Several articles from the late 1960s discussed the intertwined problems of the US balance of payments and global liquidity until the IMF introduced an artificial reserve asset, special drawing rights (SDRs), featured prominently on the December 1969 cover. For developing economies, which had hoped for a link between SDR allocations and development finance, the IMF could trot out only its standard policy prescription\u2014reiterated in several F&D articles\u2014that monetary and exchange rate stability were the sine qua non of economic development.\n\nAs the 1960s neared their end, so did the Bretton Woods system, which would collapse only a few years later. But F&D was a success: between 1964 and 1968, circulation in its three original languages\u2014English, French, and Spanish\u2014rose from 20,000 to 85,000. The magazine had established itself as a serious medium for communicating the work of the Bank and the Fund. Tentatively at first, but with increasing confidence, its editors began playing with color and graphics by including larger and more frequent photographs, maps, charts, and illustrations.\n\nThe turbulent 1970s\n\nThe 1970s was a stormy decade\u2014punctuated by the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, massive oil price shocks, and international terrorism. But it was also a time of experimentation. The Second Amendment to the IMF\u2019s Articles of Agreement, in 1978, allowed members to choose their exchange rate regime\u2014fixed or floating. More significantly, as the Fund\u2019s economic counsellor explained in F&D\u2019s June 1976 issue, it represented a revolution in thinking about the stability of the international monetary system.\n\nUnder Bretton Woods, stability was premised on countries maintaining fixed exchange rates against the dollar. After the Second Amendment, countries would direct their monetary and fiscal policies toward domestic stability, with exchange rate stability emerging from good economic policies, regardless of choice of exchange rate regime. Future IMF surveillance, therefore, would expand to include not only external stability but domestic policies and stability as well. This would open the door to an expanding scope of Fund surveillance, which today covers such diverse topics as gender equality, governance, and climate change.\n\n\n\nThe road to the Second Amendment was bumpy, and F&D strove to inform readers of efforts to reform the international monetary system, debates on fixed versus floating exchange rates, dislocations caused by oil price shocks, and the practicalities of implementing the amended Articles. Developing economies again clamored for an SDR-development link and were again rebuffed. Instead, the IMF offered the Extended Fund Facility, which provided for longer arrangements (and repayment periods) than the traditional Stand-By Arrangements, and made its first foray into concessional lending through a new trust fund (given prominence in F&D\u2019s December 1976 issue). The magnitude of the oil price shock meant that to meet its members\u2019 demands, the IMF had to supplement its quota resources with the funds it borrowed from oil exporters\u2014in effect, recycling petrodollars. In June 1975, F&D added an Arabic language edition.\n\nThe 1970s was a stormy decade\u2014punctuated by the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, massive oil price shocks, and international terrorism.\n\nThe World Bank was also undergoing a revolution. F&D reported extensively on the 1973 Nairobi Annual Meetings, at which McNamara stressed the need to tackle absolute poverty directly. The Bank (and the broader development community) was beginning to recognize that gross national product growth \u201coften does not filter down.\u201d But the answer was not handouts: McNamara figured that the only durable solution was raising the productivity of the (mostly rural) poor. F&D explored the types of World Bank projects, writing that they were no longer \u201cthe monolithic, engineering projects of the late 1940s and early 1950s\u201d but multifaceted, complex, sophisticated operations. Throughout the 1970s, F&D showcased Bank initiatives to help the small farmer access credit, seeds, and fertilizer, complemented by expanded provision of education, health care, irrigation, and public transportation.\n\nBack at the editorial offices of F&D, the editors experimented with funkier fonts and formats, as seen in the March 1973 issue. More substantively, they began exploring novel topics. A 1969 F&D article first spotlighted weather as \u201ca key variable in economic development to which economic and financial institutions have so far given little attention.\u201d In December 1971, Margaret de Vries\u2014the Fund\u2019s pioneering female division chief\u2014wrote a compelling piece on women\u2019s role in economic development. The magazine also highlighted the benefits of guest workers in Europe, noting the advantages for both migrants and host countries, even as the latter were beginning to grapple with immigration\u2019s social and political impact.\n\n1980s: The lost decade\n\nIn advanced economies, the Margaret Thatcher\u2013Ronald Reagan years are remembered for Wall Street\u2019s excesses. But for much of the developing world, the 1980s was a lost decade.\n\nAt the end of the 1970s, the Federal Reserve pulled hard on its monetary reins to curb high US inflation. Soaring global interest rates brought the easy-money lending of the previous decade to an abrupt end and sent indebted developing economies into a tailspin. At the IMF, the new watchword was \u201cconditionality.\u201d Not only was meeting certain policy conditions the key to unlocking Fund resources\u2014as F&D\u2019s March 1981 cover made clear\u2014it was also essential to successful adjustment, so that fresh lending did not simply mean piling on more debt.\n\n\n\nAt the World Bank, there was increasing recognition that investment projects, regardless of their internal rate of return, could never thrive if the macroeconomic environment was in disarray. The answer was a new type of lending: structural adjustment loans providing budget support for economic reforms. Both Bank and Fund programs stressed the need to restore internal and external balance\u2014on the demand side, by cutting budget deficits and imposing monetary discipline, and on the supply side, through devaluation, privatization, and liberalization.\n\nDeveloping economies resented this new direction. Critics decried the harsh measures and strict conditionality, which they claimed unnecessarily exacerbated economic hardship, especially for the poor. F&D played a crucial role here in explaining that timely and orderly adjustment, despite short-term pain, would lead to longer-term gains, including higher growth, improved living standards, and better income distribution.\n\nOther articles advocated market-oriented reforms, especially trade liberalization over protectionism and import substitution. The East Asian economies were showcased for their successful adjustment and lauded for their trade openness, which\u2014F&D authors claimed\u2014had resulted in faster recovery and growth (although, in reality, these countries were also distinguished by extensive government intervention). F&D also began to take notice of China, which had just embarked on market-oriented reforms; in June 1983, it began to publish in Chinese.\n\nAs the debt crisis dragged on and adjustment fatigue set in, it became increasingly clear that aggressive adjustment had a disproportionate impact on the poor. To be politically sustainable, programs would need to do more to protect the most vulnerable. Through the pages of F&D, readers could trace the evolution of the international community\u2019s debt strategy: an initial emphasis on adjustment; the 1985 Baker Plan premised on countries \u201cgrowing out\u201d of their indebtedness; and finally acceptance, under the 1989 Brady Plan and Paris Club Toronto terms, that only debt relief\u2014from both market and official bilateral creditors\u2014could resolve the crisis.\n\nF&D also covered the World Bank\u2019s growing involvement in environmental concerns, which began with the establishment of a small unit in 1970 and received further impetus during Barber Conable\u2019s presidency (1986\u201391). Against a backdrop of public criticism of the environmental impact of certain World Bank projects, F&D began publishing articles on the Bank\u2019s shift toward viewing environmental preservation as part of sustainable development.\n\nF&D opened up to external authors, starting with Nicholas Kaldor in June 1983. Guest articles were clearly identified, lest there be any confusion that they represented institutional views, and Kaldor\u2019s piece\u2014questioning IMF orthodoxy about currency devaluations\u2014was published alongside a rejoinder by F&D\u2019s editor-in-chief. Nonetheless, these articles helped introduce an element of debate, paving the way for F&D to become less a vehicle for disseminating Bank and Fund views and more of a platform for discourse.\n\n1990s: Transition\n\nWith cover art reminiscent of 1930s Soviet propaganda posters, F&D\u2019s March 1990 issue explored the biggest story of the decade: the fall of communism and seeming triumph of liberalism. The Bank and the Fund\u2014together with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the nascent European Bank for Reconstruction and Development\u2014were already at work on A Study of the Soviet Economy, which concluded (as a 1991 F&D article explained) that the required reforms were interconnected: gradualism would not work; \u201cshock-therapy\u201d was needed. Subsequent F&D issues explored various aspects of the transition\u2014fiscal consolidation, monetary reform, privatization, reorientation of industries, corporate governance\u2014occasionally giving voice to those who called for \u201cless shock, more therapy.\u201d\n\n\n\nOutside the transition economies, developing economies and emerging markets were also transforming, accepting most of the ideas and broader impetus toward liberalization\u2014while rejecting the rhetoric\u2014of the so-called Washington Consensus. However, as the Bank\u2019s East Asian Miracle report\u2014referenced on the cover of F&D\u2019s March 1994 issue\u2014acknowledged, state intervention could be constructive, provided there was \u201cgood governance.\u201d\n\nOptimism about unbridled market capitalism was tested by the 1990s emerging market crises. As part of liberalization efforts, many emerging market economies had dismantled their capital controls, inviting large inflows. Before long, however, the 1994 devaluation by Mexico\u2014followed shortly by Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and T\u00fcrkiye\u2014demonstrated the devastating consequences of sharp reversals of capital flows. While the roots of individual capital account crises were country-specific, in each case, balance sheet mismatches\u2014such as loans denominated in dollars that had to be paid off from assets that generated local currency\u2014left economies vulnerable to destabilizing events, whether domestic or external, economic or political.\n\nHaving unveiled for the first time the dark side of financial globalization, the 1997\u201398 Asian Crisis and its lessons ushered in numerous IMF reforms, detailed in the June 1998 F&D. Emerging market crises more generally spurred various initiatives (such as standards and codes, the Financial Sector Assessment Program, and early-warning systems) to strengthen the international financial architecture.\n\nThe magazine became a platform where topics of importance to the Fund could be debated by the world\u2019s leading experts.\n\n\n\nTransition economies and emerging markets may have grabbed F&D headlines, but low-income countries were no less important. The IMF had long maintained that macroeconomic stability was necessary for growth, and growth for poverty reduction. The intellectual leap\u2014articulated in F&D\u2019s How We Can Help the Poor (December 2000)\u2014was recognizing that \u201cnecessary\u201d did not imply \u201csufficient\u201d: poverty reduction should be a goal of its own, alongside growth. Accordingly, the Fund\u2019s marquee Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility became the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. Government officials and civil society would now craft their own poverty reduction strategies in a participatory process, enhancing program ownership. In recognition of countries\u2019 reform efforts, the Fund and Bank also agreed to debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (supplemented in the mid-2000s by the even more ambitious Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative).\n\nF&D itself changed profoundly. Soon after James Wolfensohn arrived at the World Bank in 1995, the Bank withdrew from the F&D partnership. The Fund, however, recognized F&D\u2019s value and agreed to finance it on its own. Despite this shift, F&D\u2019s 110,000+ subscribers would see little change in the coverage of topics. More noticeable was the new emphasis on visual communication, with arresting covers and four-color printing, as well as more external\u2014and even critical\u2014perspectives. In March 1996, F&D also began supplementing its print editions with digital content.\n\nInto the new millennium\n\nOver the next few years, F&D emerged in its modern format. With the advent of greater transparency and publication of IMF documents, there was less need for F&D to act as its mouthpiece. Instead, the magazine became a platform where topics of importance to the Fund could be debated by the world\u2019s leading experts. The issues also became more thematic.\n\n\n\nAlso in the early 2000s, emerging markets arrived on the world stage. Asian economies led the pack: the crisis countries had recovered, and the sleeping giants\u2014China and India\u2014had awakened. But it was not only Asia: Latin America\u2019s and even Africa\u2019s performance and prospects were much improved. The major emerging markets, now accounting for a growing share of world output but still holding only a minority of IMF quotas, started demanding a larger seat at the table.\n\nBut East Asia\u2019s export-led boom was not without drawbacks. As emerging markets\u2014especially China, which became a manufacturing and exporting powerhouse after its 2001 World Trade Organization accession\u2014made inroads into the advanced economies\u2019 industrial sectors, they sparked a protectionist backlash. Even as the Doha Round of trade liberalization stalled, the Bretton Woods institutions continued to champion trade and globalization: all countries could improve their lot by Trading Up (F&D, September 2002). For poorer countries, the prescription was still that trade liberalization\u2014as much as increased aid\u2014held the key to boosting growth and eradicating poverty. Meanwhile, advanced economy workers\u2019 worries about job losses were dismissed on the grounds that trade creates enough winners that they could compensate losers.\n\nAt a macroeconomic level, Asia\u2019s rise was reflected in \u201cglobal imbalances\u201d\u2014principally, China\u2019s surplus and the US deficit, causing trade and exchange rate frictions between them. The systemic concern\u2014which prompted the IMF in 2006 to convene its first Multilateral Consultation\u2014was that the buildup of US liabilities could reach a tipping point, and investors might lose confidence and dump their dollars, precipitating a global crisis. In fact, the imbalances were but a symptom: the roots of the 2008 crisis were deeper.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, the world economy was booming, but only as a result of a triple bubble:\n\nExcess saving and production in Asia could be sustained only by the huge current account deficit of the United States, which became the consumer of last resort.\n\nStagnating real wages and a declining share of labor income in the US\u2014including as a result of manufacturing jobs moving to emerging markets\u2014meant that middle-class consumption could be sustained only by ever-increasing amounts of consumer credit (often in the form of equity withdrawals from rising house prices).\n\nIn the euro area, a similar bubble sustained northern European surpluses and southern European deficits.\n\nThese factors were enabled\u2014and exacerbated\u2014by financial sector excesses that flourished under poor regulation. While F&D picked up on some of these elements, it failed, along with most other observers, to connect the dots and recognize that, as these bubbles burst, the world economy would suffer its worst crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nCrisis and recovery\n\nEven before the bankruptcy of US investment bank Lehman Brothers sparked global financial panic, F&D\u2019s June 2008 issue pointed to opaque, complex mortgage-backed securities, coupled with excessive leverage and regulatory failures, as the source of the financial problems in the United States. Lehman\u2019s failure in September and the spread of the ensuing full-blown crisis to the rest of the world, received ample coverage in F&D\u2019s December 2008 issue.\n\nOver the following year, the magazine detailed the IMF\u2019s crisis response: overhauling its lending tool kit to make it more flexible and responsive to countries\u2019 needs; improving surveillance to better anticipate crises and take account of spillovers; and, together with the Financial Stability Board, strengthening its oversight of the global financial system. The Fund also provided additional support to low-income countries and revived SDRs\u2014its first allocation since the 1970s\u2014to boost the global economy with an immediate injection of unconditional liquidity.\n\n\n\nAs the crisis broke, Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn famously called for emergency fiscal stimulus. Countries heeded the call, with Asia leading the way. China\u2019s massive fiscal expansion in particular served as a locomotive for the rest of the global economy. Major central banks pumped emergency liquidity into their markets, established cross-border swap lines, and engaged in quantitative easing. These actions were essential to avoiding an implosion of the world economy, though they also resulted in unwanted surges of capital flows to emerging markets.\n\nBy December 2009, the worst of the storm had passed. But the scars of the crisis\u2014structural unemployment, income inequality, protectionism, and anti-globalization sentiment\u2014ran deep. These now became the focus of F&D. In Jobs on the Line\u2014whose cover drew inspiration from Diego Rivera\u2019s 1932 homage to the American worker\u2014F&D explored how migration, outsourcing, technology, and trade were affecting job prospects. It pointed to a basic dilemma for policymakers: greater openness to migrants, trade, and technology brought economic benefits but also political costs, as the middle class felt threatened. While retooling and further education were part of the answer, F&D said, \u201cfor displaced workers near the end of their working lives, redistribution may be a more practical solution than acquisition of new skills.\u201d\n\nThe September 2011 F&D explored a related issue: public resentment of growing income inequality in advanced economies, in part because of perceptions that banks had been bailed out on the backs of workers. The risk was that people would \u201cno longer support open trade and free markets if they feel that they are losing out while a small group of winners is getting richer and richer.\u201d\n\nF&D has stayed true to its purpose of engaging, educating, and entertaining its readership.\n\nA fraught, fragmented world\n\nBy 2016, after the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, fragmentation was no longer a risk but a reality. Just as the global recovery seemed to have reached an inflection point, it faced setbacks from rising nationalism, protectionism, and populism. Earlier doubts about globalization now turned into open trade wars and xenophobia. Movements like Occupy Wall Street morphed into calls for antiestablishment politicians and wholesale rejection of expertise. Not only had the consensus and cooperative spirit of the early days of the crisis melted away, it had turned into a willful desire to break agreements, reconsider alliances, and retreat from multilateralism.\n\n\n\nF&D sought to diagnose this new reality. The December 2016 issue\u2014featuring a stolid blue-collar worker on its cover\u2014explored the hollowing out of the American middle class and the root causes of disaffection gripping electorates in advanced economies. While globalization seemed like the obvious culprit, the March 2017 issue evaluated a different hypothesis: secular stagnation. The key question\u2014as F&D posed it\u2014was whether advanced economies should resign themselves to anemic growth or whether policies could revive productivity. Summing up the mood of the era, the December 2018 F&D, Age of Insecurity, asked what remains of the social contract in the 21st century, when the elderly worry that they will outlive their pensions while millennials fret that they will never earn theirs in the first place.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic dealt the next blow. The IMF pulled out its crisis playbook, swiftly providing emergency financing to an unprecedented number of countries. It also issued a record number of SDRs, with the 2022 Resilience and Sustainability Trust finally providing an ingenious\u2014albeit partial\u2014workaround in response to developing economies\u2019 long-standing gripe that allocations are proportional to quota rather than countries\u2019 structural financing needs. But what should have brought the world together instead amplified divisions, culminating in \u201cvaccine protectionism.\u201d\n\nBeyond assessing the pandemic\u2019s immediate impact, F&D pondered its longer-term implications for economic opportunity, inequality, technology, health, and the praxis of fiscal policy. It also urged its readers to see the pandemic as an opportunity for healing the fractures and building back a better world (September 2020 F&D).\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine delivered the next set of shocks: refugees, supply-chain disruptions, food and energy shortages, high inflation, and unstable financial markets. Against the backdrop of rising US-China rivalry and the world\u2019s dangerous drift into distinct economic blocs, the war has reinforced the sense that countries must take sides. To help its readers make sense of this landscape, F&D explored its impact on policymaking, the global economy, energy insecurity, and disintegration of global trade.\n\nWhat next for the Fund? Forged in the crucible of war and created to foster multilateralism and international cooperation, its mission is more vital than ever. But to fulfill it effectively in an increasingly complex and shock-prone world, its staff need to look up from their spreadsheets and study issues outside their traditional domain. F&D is doing its part, delving into a panoply of topics ranging from health, demographics, and inequality to digital currency and artificial intelligence. Its most recent issue takes stock of what it all means for the economics discipline itself.\n\nAhead of its time\n\n\n\nF&D was originally intended to keep readers abreast of World Bank and IMF developments; it has done so admirably. But it has also evolved into a vital forum for debate on critical economic issues. And on some topics\u2014the environment, the role of women, the rise of China\u2014F&D has been ahead of the curve.\n\nIn June 2019, the magazine carried a fictional account of John Maynard Keynes returning to visit the Fund on its 75th anniversary, where he marvels that\u2014despite myriad changes\u2014the institution remains true to its purpose of serving its membership. Over the past 60 years, F&D, too, has witnessed\u2014and experienced\u2014numerous transformations while staying true to its purpose of engaging, educating, and entertaining its readership.",

      "title": "Stock market today: Stocks slip as US economy starts to show cracks",
      "news": "US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors weighed signs the surprising resilience in the US economy might be starting to show cracks.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped 0.4% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.3% after both indexes closed higher in the prior session during a bumpy day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered just below the flatline.\n\nStocks have struggled to find a footing as investors face a dilemma over the path of interest rates. Recent weak manufacturing data has prompted Wall Street strategists to scale back their optimism for economic growth, which supports a case for rate cuts. But Federal Reserve officials have warned against hoping for a pivot anytime soon as they wait for inflation to cool sufficiently \u2014 and when that time comes isn't clear.\n\nJob openings fell in April to their lowest level since February 2021 as the labor market shows further signs of rebalancing. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed 8.05 million openings at the end of April, a decrease from the 8.35 million open jobs in March.\n\nThe labor market update serves as a precursor to the crucial May jobs report on Friday \u2014 the data highlight of the week.\n\nRead more: How does the labor market affect inflation?\n\nMeanwhile, the GameStop (GME) rally \u2014 just one part of the jumpy summer start for stocks \u2014 lost steam on Tuesday, on the heels of a 21% surge for the meme darling. Shares of the video game retailer were down about 5% during the session.\n\nElsewhere, India's stock benchmark plummeted, wiping out almost $35 billion in value, after touching all-time highs on Monday. The vote count in the country's national elections put the majority held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party in doubt, despite exit polls showing a likely landslide win.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled Narendra Modi and GameStop.

      "news": "\u00a9Shutterstock.com\n\nOverspending is a serious and all too common problem in the U.S. It\u2019s dangerous because it usually creates credit card debt and forces you to have an even more difficult time getting by amid inflation and rising costs of living. You may be surprised to hear that it isn\u2019t just middle-class Americans and lower-income earners who are prone to overspending. Wealthy people do it too and it can take its toll on their financial health as it can anybody else.\n\nDiscover Next: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: Here\u2019s My Monthly Budget\n\nFind Out: 4 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\n\nGOBankingRates sat down with Anthony DeLuca, certified financial planner (CFP), certified divorce financial analyst (CDFA) and expert contributor for Annuity.org to find out what the wealthy most commonly overspend on.\n\nAlso see 10 ways high-income earners can go broke.\n\nWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.\n\nPrestigious Colleges\n\nDeLuca doesn\u2019t argue the importance of a college degree. He explained that according to the AAC&U, 82% of business executives and 75% of hiring managers feel that a degree is necessary for success. But a great college education isn\u2019t exclusive to expensive or famous universities. Wealthy people may overspend here.\n\n\u201cThere is a diminishing return of worth between enrolling in a prestigious school and going into serious debt,\u201d DeLuca said. \u201cThere is little use in paying an out-of-state tuition for a private school when you could pay in-state tuition for a state university that can offer nearly the same benefits for way cheaper.\u201d\n\nRead More: Jeff Bezos\u2019 Billion-Dollar Life: A Look at His Mansion Collection\n\nExpensive Hotels or Resorts\n\nMany Americans overspend on vacations, including wealthy individuals.\n\n\u201cSpeaking from personal anecdotes, you can experience amazing vacations without paying for an overpriced 5-star resort,\u201d DeLuca said.\n\n\u201cEspecially for the adventures, what is the use of paying for an all-inclusive resort if most of your time is spent away from the facility?\u201d\n\nDining Out\n\nThe middle class and lower-income people may be tired of meal prepping and staying in for dinner so often to save on food costs. They may dream of becoming wealthy enough to be able to dine out all the time. This is a bad idea and a root of overspending among high rollers.\n\n\u201cEating out and expensive wine is obvious, but necessary to mention due to frequency,\u201d DeLuca said. \u201cThe cost of gas and rising inflation has significantly increased the cost of food and service. A fine dining restaurant does not escape this math.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOne night out with good food and wine can equate to nearly a month of groceries if bought in bulk,\u201d he said. \u201cA bad habit like this eats up your wallet rather quickly.\u201d\n\nDesigner Clothing\n\nDesigner clothing is always in demand, but expensive style isn\u2019t a necessity and it\u2019s something the rich may overspend on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one to point fingers, but many people wear brands strictly for the stature they seek from it rather than the use and purpose,\u201d DeLuca said.\n\n\u201cThere are so many clothing brands that you can find online that nearly mirror \u2018high-end\u2019 brands for a fraction of the cost,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of whether you derive purpose in the use of the clothing or the stature you are seeking.\u201d\n\nBuying Real Estate, Without Understanding the Market\n\nInvesting in real estate to rent out can be a super savvy move and one that many financial experts recommend, but too often wealthy folks get in on this action without fully comprehending the rental market.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one to say that short-term renting is oversaturated,\u201d DeLuca said. \u201cWhat I am here to say is that investors buy property without doing proper demographic studies on the area. What they are left with is multiple pieces of real estate with monthly mortgages and HOA fees.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not buy because you can. Buy because the numbers are right,\u201d he said. \u201cI have met investors who buy in areas, because \u2018they like the area.\u2019 That does not mean that everybody else will. Make sure there is a demand.\u201d\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I\u2019m a Financial Planner: 5 Things Rich People Do That Cost Too Much \u2014 Even for Them",

      "title": "Empowering women in finance: Insights from the 8th annual Women\u2019s Stock Pitch",
      "news": "In April, William & Mary\u2019s Raymond A. Mason School of Business hosted the eighth annual Women\u2019s Stock Pitch in Miller Hall, transcending borders and celebrating women in finance.\n\nGathering small teams of three to four women from each university spanning six countries and 12 states, this symposium was a nexus of talent, passion and dedication, drawing participants, talented alumni and corporate sponsors. It was also the most regionally diverse competition to date.\n\nThe journey commenced in December 2023 for many, marked by tireless preparation and exhaustive research. Teams meticulously scrutinized companies, crafting investment theses that resonated with their values and convictions. Xuantong Tan, representing the National University of Singapore, articulated her team\u2019s enthusiasm for Neste, a Finnish enterprise specializing in sustainable fuel systems. She emphasized their pitch\u2019s compelling narrative, highlighting the company\u2019s resolute purpose and focus.\n\n\u201cOur team really wanted to pitch more than just a company,\u201d Tan said. \u201cWe felt that Neste had a compelling story that needed to be told, which became the driving force behind our pitch.\u201d\n\nKendyl George \u201926, a finance student at William & Mary, reflected on the camaraderie fostered during the arduous preparation phase. Daily rehearsals honed their presentation skills and forged deep bonds among teammates, providing vital support during moments of apprehension.\n\n\u201cConsistent daily practice facilitated mutual support, enhancing our cohesion and confidence during moments of apprehension,\u201d said George. \u201cWe aided one another in memorization and provided prompts when necessary or if one of us drew a blank. Moreover, our collective presence and encouragement during the competition further reinforced our unity.\u201d\n\nThe culmination of months of dedication unfolded on April 6 as teams navigated three rigorous rounds of competition. The intensity peaked in the final showdown, where Utah State University, Memorial University of Newfoundland and New York University emerged as the triumphant finalists.\n\nFollowing lively presentations and probing inquiries from four industry experts who made up the judges panel, Utah State clinched the top honor. Close behind, Memorial University placed second and New York University third. Each award was accompanied by a cash prize, a well-earned recognition of their achievements.\n\n\u201cThese events are so inspiring,\u201d remarked Emerald Spencer of Utah State University, highlighting the newfound confidence and passion for finance instilled by the competition. \u201cWinning has heightened my inspiration, particularly as I hadn\u2019t anticipated such an achievement. The practical application of classroom knowledge through experiential learning has been transformative. I now possess a genuine enthusiasm and knowledge of a specific company, enabling me to recommend investment opportunities confidently.\u201d\n\nUtah State University\u2019s team won first place. (Raymond A. Mason School of Business photo)\n\nThe event\u2019s significance transcended mere competition; it served as a platform for empowerment and mentorship. Catherine Faddis \u201991, a distinguished alumna and senior portfolio manager at Zevin Asset Management, imparted invaluable insights in her Saturday keynote, urging attendees to cherish this critical juncture in their professional journeys.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unique and valuable because they get to see in real-time what it\u2019s like to pitch a stock to an investor. I wish I had this opportunity as a student,\u201d Faddis said. \u201cI think women who are here are rock stars. They are light-years ahead of anyone. They are learning so much more than they realize. I think they will look back on this as one of the pivotal moments in their life.\u201d\n\nMolly Pieroni, president at Yacktman Asset Management, emphasized the importance of the Women\u2019s Stock Pitch in amplifying female voices in the finance sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about women sharing their ideas, defending their theses and competing in a supportive environment,\u201d noted Pieroni. \u201cIt\u2019s a women\u2019s stock pitch competition because women need a voice, and sometimes women need a little boost to use their voice.\u201d\n\nFor participants like Xuantong Tan, the event provided an invaluable opportunity to connect with peers facing similar challenges in the industry, fostering a network of support for future endeavors.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think it\u2019s about connecting with people who have had similar experiences,\u201d Tan said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about building a network of women who are interested in this field to be able to support each other.\u201d\n\nKendyl George said she is grateful for all the corporate partners who send participants to the stock pitch each year. At the 2023 stock pitch, George met a female representative from a corporate partner who provided her guidance in her finance journey.\n\n\u201cWe initially connected during my freshman year, and our bond grew stronger when she returned this year. Upon securing a position on the 2024 stock pitch team, I contacted her via email, and her unwavering support was invaluable,\u201d said George. \u201cOur relationship flourished through our shared involvement in the Women\u2019s Stock Pitch. It\u2019s remarkable how this opportunity catalyzes meaningful connections, fostering relationships that endure long after the event itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s also great that men attend the competition,\u201d she added, highlighting the importance of advocacy and collaboration across genders in advancing diversity and inclusion in finance. The competition is open to male competitors and includes male-ally ambassadors assisting teams in various tasks.\n\n\u201cEach year, this platform empowers women to showcase their confidence and competence in finance roles,\u201d said George. \u201cIt\u2019s also encouraging to see men participating, fostering advocacy and inclusivity. In business, networking is paramount, regardless of gender. We must support and uplift each other, recognizing that success is collective.\u201d\n\nThe event\u2019s international allure attracted participants like Rona Yaniv from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who relished engaging with diverse perspectives and global thought leaders. Indeed, as Kendyl George noted, the competition\u2019s international dimension enriched the discourse, reinforcing the universality of stock pitching as a language of opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe transition from Israel\u2019s informal social structure to the American way of life is intriguing. Collaborating with international teams and gaining insights into other countries\u2019 businesses and finances are the motivating factors behind this journey,\u201d conveyed Yaniv.\n\nJulie Agnew \u201991, Richard C. Kraemer Term Professor of Business and the Boehly Center for Excellence in Finance executive faculty director, credited William & Mary\u2019s commitment to experiential learning for fostering initiatives like the Women\u2019s Stock Pitch.\n\n\u201cWilliam & Mary is the only place to go if you want to go into finance. This is a school where we value creative thinkers and collaborative people,\u201d Agnew said. \u201cThe key to our ongoing success, as evidenced by our strong performance in recent finance surveys featured in the Wall Street Journal, lies in our remarkable alumni network. They are people who come back to share their expertise with current students. You get such a supportive community when you come here.\u201d\n\nMatthew Brady Siano, managing director emeritus at Two Sigma, adjunct faculty member at the Mason School and Board Member of the Raymond A. Mason School of Business Foundation, has been involved with the Women\u2019s Stock Pitch since its inception over eight years ago.\n\nIn his initial years as an adjunct professor, Siano said he saw too many women students pull out of finance because they didn\u2019t think they could \u201cmake it\u201d on Wall Street. Despite trying to convince them otherwise, Siano said these students struggle to envision themselves finding their place in America\u2019s financial capital. He explained that he equally understood, as a Foundation Board member, that in order for the Mason School to thrive, it needed to work to place more of its women graduates on Wall Street and into finance more broadly.\n\n\u201cI made it my mission to try to find a way to encourage more of our female graduates and finance majors to recognize that Wall Street is a place for them and that they could do well there and succeed in that environment,\u201d Siano said. \u201cI felt the stock pitch competition was a great way for them \u2014 and for women from other universities \u2014 to meet each other and to see that they can all do this.\u201d\n\nLisa Petrelli, the opening keynote speaker and head of global markets for Canada at UBS, commended the university\u2019s role in propelling women forward in finance.\n\n\u201cThere is momentum behind this, and it\u2019s carrying us forward. That\u2019s what\u2019s most exciting. It\u2019s a joy to see the groundswell of energy moving this forward. Enjoy these moments. There is a community around you, and it\u2019s global,\u201d Petrelli said. \u201cThis event is starting to take over the world.\u201d\n\nAs the eighth year of the Women\u2019s Stock Pitch concluded, it was evident that the event\u2019s impact reverberated far beyond the confines of Miller Hall. Each presentation and exchange illuminated a path forward for the many women bold enough to seize a career in finance.\n\nHannah Sawyer '27 and Raymond A. Mason School of Business staff",

      "title": "Consumer Finance State Roundup - May 2024",
      "news": "The latest edition of the Consumer Finance State Roundup features recently enacted measures of potential interest from Colorado and South Carolina:\n\nColorado: Effective May 17, House Bill 24-1011 (2024 Colo. Sess. Laws 189) adds new Section 38-40-106 to the Colorado Revised Statutes addressing requirements for mortgage servicers with respect to the disbursement of insurance proceeds in connection with mortgaged residential property.\n\nFirst, the new section sets forth certain actions that mortgage servicers must take regarding disbursement of insurance proceeds to borrowers. Upon a borrower\u2019s request, a mortgage servicer must promptly disclose to the borrower specific conditions under which it will disburse insurance proceeds to the borrower in the event a residential property subject to a mortgage is damaged or destroyed and an insurance company pays insurance proceeds to satisfy a claim for such damage or destruction. Next, upon receipt from a borrower of a \u201crepair plan\u201d or a \u201crebuild plan\u201d (either of which the borrower must develop in consultation with a contractor), a mortgage servicer has 30 days to approve or deny such plan. A repair plan or rebuild plan must include specific milestones, enumerated in the new section, that require the mortgage servicer to disburse insurance proceeds in certain amounts upon meeting those milestones.\n\nSecond, immediately when it begins servicing a borrower\u2019s mortgage and upon the borrower\u2019s request thereafter, a mortgage servicer must disclose to the borrower the interest rate associated with the mortgage and provide the borrower with contact information of a primary point of contact for communication with the mortgage servicer.\n\nFinally, the measure makes conforming amendments to the Non-bank Mortgage Servicers Act by adding new Section 5-21-107.5, and repeals Section 10-4-112 as it pertains to property damage and time of payment provisions.\n\nSouth Carolina: Effective November 21, Senate Bill 700 enacts the \u201cSouth Carolina Earned Wage Access Services Act,\u201d (the \u201cAct\u201d), S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 39-5-810 et seq. For purposes of the Act, \u201cearned wage access services\u201d means \u201cthe business of providing consumer-directed wage access services [\u201coffering or providing earned wage access services directly to consumers\u201d] or employer-integrated wage services.\u201d In addition to administrative provisions (e.g., application, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements), we note the following:\n\nFirst, the Act requires a \u201cprovider\u201d \u2013 a business entity that will engage in the business of providing earned wage access services to consumers \u2013 to register with the South Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs (\u201cDepartment\u201d). However, the Act does not apply entities doing business under South Carolina or federal laws relating to banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, savings banks, or trust companies.\n\nSecond, the Act sets forth compliance obligations for a provider. Among other requirements, a provider must: (a) develop and implement policies and procedures to respond to questions raised by consumers and address any consumer complaints in an expedient manner; and (b) offer a consumer at least one reasonable option to obtain proceeds at no cost to the consumer, and clearly explain to the consumer how to elect such no-cost option.\n\nThird, the Act prohibits a provider from engaging in certain conducting, such as charging a late fee, interest, or any other penalty or charge for failure to repay outstanding proceeds.\n\n[View source.]",

      "title": "Politics playing a role in electric vehicle adoption: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer",
      "news": "The future of the electric vehicle is a critical issue for the U.S. auto industry and its home base of Detroit, Michigan. It's also increasingly becoming a political issue, according to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nThe Biden administration's support of EV adoption includes the Inflation Reduction Act, now at odds with Donald Trump's promise to remove fuel economy mandates if he is re-elected, a policy reversal that could extend the era of gas-powered vehicles.\n\n\"We've seen politics bleed into this space,\" Whitmer said at the CNBC CEO Council Summit in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. \"Yes, we should say [research and development] is a good thing and setting the pace in the world is a good thing, but it is complicated right now like everything is.\"\n\nWhitmer, who has supported several EV-focused policies, including making all state government vehicles fully electric by 2040 and rebates that would encourage EV sales, said the auto industry understands the right strategy.\n\n\"The world is moving fast and our OEMs are being more nimble and embracing this. ... We don't take [internal combustion engine cars] off the menu of what we can offer, but until we build up the [EV] infrastructure, we know there's going to be fits and starts, but it's moving in the right direction,\" she said.\n\nAutomakers, who spent much of the last few years pushing EVs heavily, have started to lower expectations, matching a decline in interest from consumers. Political pressure from either side in the next term could alter that.\n\n\"Everything is politicized in this moment. It's an unfortunate part of where we are right now as a country,\" Whitmer said.\n\nIn the long term, the EV investment curve is tied to broader national goals on manufacturing, as well as economic and national security, which Whitmer pointed to as a sign of strength.\n\n\"For the first time in a real long time, we've got a real strategy as we look to rebuild manufacturing in this country, and we saw during the pandemic how bad it was on so many fronts, not just on the jobs but on homeland security,\" she said. \"We've got to have manufacturing growth in this country and it's happening with a sustained and real focus ... Making sure we are building the cars of the future is an important part of that security, and good paying jobs, and supporting an industry that is trying to move fast is in all of our interest.\"\n\nWhitmer, a Democrat who said she grew up in a household with a Republican father and a Democratic mother, spent her first term as governor in 2018 in the minority across the state, and even as Michigan shifted left in more recent years, the state still has several Republican stronghold districts.\n\n\"I think it's important that we teach people to ask questions to try to take in as much information, whether sitting across the table from someone with very different politics or a very different set of experiences,\" she said.\n\nCNBC \"Squawk on the Street\" co-anchor Carl Quintanilla asked Whitmer if that approach makes it hard to stay true to her principles.\n\n\"I don't think [listening] changes your values, but you always have to be able to learn and to understand what's going on,\" Whitmer said.\n\nShe first ran for governor with a promise to fix the state's roads, a goal that came out of conversations she had with people from both parties and what they said would make their lives better.\n\nShe voiced support for an energy policy that has not been popular on the left in recent history but has received renewed attention nationally.\n\n\"We're going to meet our energy goals and our climate goals and nuclear is an important part of the equation. Do you think the public is ready to talk about nuclear again? I wasn't sure what to expect but in the community, we've seen great support,\" she said.\n\n\"These are good-paying jobs, they are intertwined with our clean energy goals and having energy independence which is crucial for our economy and security and we've gotten a lot of positive feedback,\" Whitmer continued. \"There is a generation that is uncomfortable but most of it has been positive.\"\n\nWhitmer acknowledged that sticking to her principles has opened her up to criticism, but that's inevitable right now.\n\n\"One of the things that I'm always acutely aware of is that in this environment, no deed goes uncriticized,\" Whitmer said. \"Once I accepted that, it's been liberating because it frees me up to not try to anticipate how we make everyone happy because it's an impossible task.\"\n\n\"I think some of this might be paralyzing if you were trying to make everyone happy; forget it,\" she said. \"You're not going to be able to do it. Do the next right thing, on behalf of your employees, on behalf of your employees, on behalf of your community.\"",

      "news": "Washington \u2014 Weeks after the House Judiciary Committee voted to advance a contempt of Congress resolution against him, Attorney General Merrick Garland is appearing before the panel for an oversight hearing, where he is pushing back against the move as unfounded and serving \"no legitimate purpose.\"\n\nHouse Republicans on the Judiciary and Oversight Committees last month voted to move forward with contempt resolutions against Garland for defying their request for audio recordings from the federal probe into President Biden's handling of classified records.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland is sworn in during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Department of Justice, Tuesday, June 4, 2024, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Jacquelyn Martin / AP\n\nThe Justice Department said on the eve of the contempt vote that it could not comply with the congressional subpoena for a recording of former special counsel Robert Hur's interview with Mr. Biden because the president asserted executive privilege over the audio. Prosecutors had previously released the deposition transcript and it remains uncertain whether the contempt vote will be brought to the full House for a vote.\n\nThe attorney general struck a more defiant tone than in past hearings, telling the committee, \"I will not be intimidated.

And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has argued handing over the actual recording of Mr. Biden's interview risked chilling future investigations.\n\n\"I view contempt as a serious matter,\" Garland said Tuesday. \"But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"\n\nThe special counsel, who was appointed by Garland to lead the probe, opted not to charge Mr. Biden as part of the investigation, but criticized his handling of the classified records and questioned whether prosecutors would have been able to convince a jury to convict Mr. Biden, given his age and memory.\n\nIn response to last month's executive privilege claim, Jim Jordan, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee alleged, \"President Biden is asserting executive privilege for the same reason we need the audio recordings \u2014 they offer a unique perspective.\"\n\nThe White House and Mr. Biden rejected Hur's characterizations of the president's recall in the interview and argued the transcript offered a more complete representation of the deposition.\n\nHur is not the only special counsel Garland has appointed in his three years leading the Justice Department, and he is likely not the only independent investigator for whom Garland will have to answer while testifying on Tuesday.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has brought two cases against former President Donald Trump \u2014 one tied to the 2020 election and the other connected to his handling of classified records. Meanwhile, special counsel David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney from Delaware, is currently in the midst of a trial against the president's son, Hunter Biden. He alleged Hunter Biden illegally purchased a firearm while using drugs.\n\nBoth Trump and Hunter Biden have pleaded not guilty, denied wrongdoing and accused the Justice Department of letting politics influence the probes, accusations from both the political right and left that Garland has rebuffed.\n\n\"[The contempt threat] is only the most recent in a long line of attacks on the Justice Department's work,\" the attorney general told lawmakers. \"It comes alongside threats to defund particular department investigations, most recently the special counsel's prosecution of the former president.\"\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement ahead of the testimony that Garland would highlight the department's work throughout his tenure and \"forcefully push back on false narratives regarding the Department's employees and their work.\"\n\nThe three years Garland had spent atop the Justice Department have yielded results in what he has said are department priorities, including allegations of war crimes filed in connection with Russia's offensive in Ukraine, antitrust cases brought against corporate giants like Apple and Ticketmaster and efforts to curb violent crime.\n\nStill, Tuesday's testimony from the attorney general and the questions from the panel will likely highlight the partisan political tensions.\n\n\"We are seeing heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants,\" Garland said in his opening statement.\n\nNotably, he also addressed Trump's conviction in New York state court last week on 34 felony counts, calling insinuations from Trump and his supporters that the Justice Department was involved \"false.\"\n\n\"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" Garland said. \"These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and unfounded\u2026.These attacks have not \u2014 and they will not \u2014 influence our decision making.\"\n\nOne of the Justice Department's top officials, FBI Director Christopher Wray, is scheduled to appear before a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee hours after the attorney general faces the House committee.\n\nDuring his most recent appearance on Capitol Hill, Wray warned, \"I'd be hard-pressed to think of a time where so many threats to our public safety and national security were so elevated all at once.\" He is likely to reiterate those concerns on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe FBI director told Congress in April the ongoing conflict in Gaza has prompted an increase in threats against the U.S., with the most imminent danger posed by those seeking to carry out attacks on U.S. soil.\n\nDuring that testimony earlier this year, Wray, like Garland, also warned of \"increased threats\" against agents and facilities. \"Having a badge is dangerous enough. It shouldn't also make you a target,\" he said.\n\nSince then, Smith, the special counsel investigating Trump, asked a federal judge to limit the former president's public comments after Trump made false claims that FBI agents were \"authorized to shoot\" him as they executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022. Smith alleged last month that Trump had \"grossly distorted these standard practices by mischaracterizing them as a plan to kill him, his family, and U.S. Secret Service agents.\" His social media posts and campaign emails about the topic, prosecutors wrote, \"pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to the law enforcement agents.\"\n\nTrump opposed the move and the federal judge overseeing that case has yet to rule on the matter and asked for further briefing in the coming weeks.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI said, \"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"",

      "news": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he never considered forgoing a reelection bid because of his advanced age and sought to rebuff questions about his ability to serve in a wide-ranging interview with Time Magazine published Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI can do it better than anybody you know. You\u2019re looking at me, I can take you too,\u201d the president said when asked about the rigors of a second term.\n\nAsked if he\u2019s ever considered not running again because of his age, Biden, 81, said: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d He repeated his exhortation \u2014 \u201cwatch me\u201d \u2014 when pressed on voters\u2019 age-related concerns.\n\n\u201cLook, name me a president that\u2019s gotten as much done as I\u2019ve gotten done in my first three and a half years,\u201d he told the outlet.\n\nIt was a clear summation of Biden\u2019s rationale for running again, despite widespread concerns \u2013 even among Democrats \u2013 that he\u2019s too old for the job. Polling has consistently shown that age is the issue that most vexes voters who support Biden\u2019s policies and would otherwise be happy to vote for him.\n\nBiden pointed to his legislative accomplishments in the interview, including securing billions of dollars for American infrastructure and the environment despite some critics who had said there was \u201cno way\u201d he could get it done.\n\n\u201cWhen all of you wrote in Time Magazine I couldn\u2019t get any of it done \u2026 the legislation passed,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Biden acknowledged that continued national disunity was having a corrosive effect, particularly in foreign policy.\n\n\u201cI think it has a significantly diminishing impact on our ability to get things done internationally,\u201d he said. The president emphasized his continued commitment to US allies and the leading role that America should play on the world stage.\n\nHe also said American adversaries had an interest in election meddling that would favor Trump.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that meddling is going on. I\u2019m not going to get into, I don\u2019t think I should from an intelligence standpoint,\u201d he said when asked specifically about China.\n\n\u201cI think China would have an interest \u2014 let me put it like this \u2014 would have an interest in meddling,\u201d he went on. \u201cEverybody, all the bad guys are rooting for Trump, man.\u201d",

      "title": "Biden says 'every reason' to believe Netanyahu is prolonging war for political gain",
      "news": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden said in a recent interview released Tuesday that there is \"every reason\" to think Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is prolonging Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza for political gain.\n\nThe comment came in an interview conducted by Time magazine on May 28 when Biden was asked if he believes Netanyahu is prolonging the conflict for self-preservation as some in Israel have said.\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to comment on that. There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion,\" Biden said, adding that before the war, Netanyahu was facing blowback for wanting an overhaul of the nation's judicial system. \"So it\u2019s an internal domestic debate that seems to have no consequence. And whether he would change his position or not, it\u2019s hard to say, but it has not been helpful.\u201d\n\nBiden explained that his major disagreement with the Israeli prime minister is over Gaza's future after the war ends.\n\n\"What happens after Gaza\u2019s over? What, what does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in?\" he asked. \"I've been talking to the Egyptians and been talking to the Saudis. I\u2019ve been talking to the Jordanians, I\u2019ve been talking to the Emiratis. The answer is, if that\u2019s the case, it can\u2019t work. There needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution. And that\u2019s my biggest disagreement with Bibi Netanyahu.\"\n\nWhen asked if Netanyahu was the only one standing in the way of a package of proposals that might aid in transitioning to a two-state solution, Biden said he had to be careful about what he told Time because he acknowledged the magazine article would come out later on, and he was already in the process of negotiating a possible path forward.\n\n\"I think there is a clear path for a transition where the Arab states would provide security and reconstruction in Gaza in return for a longer-term commitment to a transition to a two-state solution,\" Biden said. \"And that extends all the way from Saudi Arabia, who I continue to talk to \u2014 my team \u2014 to the Jordanians that are trying to work bringing in goods and certain goods now, food, medicine, etc. And the Egyptians who I\u2019ve been talking with frequently about what happens in terms of access for more material to get into Gaza to prevent this catastrophe from continuing.\"\n\nThe interview took place last Tuesday, several days before he announced in remarks at the White House on Friday that Israel had submitted a proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nAn Israeli official, however, told NBC News on Monday that Biden's description of the offer was \"not accurate.\"\n\nBiden's relationship with Netanyahu has grown contentious since Israel entered Gaza following Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. The president has faced growing opposition from the far left of the Democratic Party over U.S. policy toward Israel in its efforts to help its close ally.\n\nAsked last week by Time if Israeli forces have committed war crimes in Gaza, Biden said. \u201cThe answer is it\u2019s uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves. The ICC is something that we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t recognize,\" he added, referring to the International Criminal Court, whose chief prosecutor sought arrest warrants last month against Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu, for alleged war crimes. \"But one thing is certain, the people in Gaza, the Palestinians have suffered greatly, for lack of food, water, medicine, etc. And a lot of innocent people have been killed.\u201d",

      "title": "Trump\u2019s Personality Cult Plays a Part in His Political Appeal",
      "news": "Trump supporters near the US Capitol following a \"Stop the Steal\" rally on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. The protesters stormed the historic building, breaking windows and clashing with police.\n\nPersonality measures suggest Donald Trump exerts a cult of personality over his followers, people who are psychologically susceptible to his appeal. This could help explain how he has succeeded in U.S. politics while other populists have not\n\nDonald Trump is now leading in many polls and could retake the U.S. presidency, despite numerous scandals, indictments and erratic behavior. Explanations for his popularity focus on factors like white identity, right-wing authoritarianism, nationalism and populism.\n\nU.S. politics has included people with these predilections for many decades, however, so the puzzle of Trump\u2019s appeal remains. Other U.S. politicians, such as Pat Buchanan, David Duke and Ross Perot, previously tried to tap into these discontented outlooks with limited success. We have also seen unsuccessful attempts to provide a more refined version of Trumpism, notably from Florida governor Ron DeSantis. What is different about Trump that has allowed him such success where others have failed?\n\nSupport from a \u201cpersonality cult\u201d\u2014something his would-be successors lack\u2014has, we believe, been essential for Trump\u2019s political success. In new research, we argue that there is an identifiable hard core of extremely loyal Trump supporters that comprise his personality cult. Members of such a cult show unquestioning loyalty to a strong leader, such as Argentina\u2019s Juan and Eva Per\u00f3n or Italy\u2019s Benito Mussolini, whom they perceive as infallible and truthful. Their devotion has religious parallels as they consider their leader a savior with unique ability to protect society against internal or external threats. Trump has himself embraced such a status in relation to his followers in statements such as \u201cI am your voice\u201d and \u201cI alone can fix it,\u201d both of which he declared at the 2016 Republican convention.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nTrump\u2019s followers are often referred to as a personality cult. Republican former representative Liz Cheney lamented that her party had \u201cembraced Donald Trump [and] embraced his cult of personality\u201d after her 2022 defeat by a Trump-backed candidate. Mainstream news media often refer to the idea of a personality cult in connection with Trump, but until now there has been little discussion of the idea by political scientists.\n\nPersonality cults are commonly associated with authoritarian systems, where a strong leader sits atop a regime with strict control of public information. It may therefore seem surprising to find this level of loyalty to a former president in the U.S. However, we identify a group of cultlike Trump followers by their loyalty and personality characteristics. We suggest that commanding such a personality cult lets Trump succeed, where other U.S. right-wing populists fail.\n\nHere\u2019s how. We collected data from two nationwide surveys of U.S. adults in 2021 and 2016, with 1,083 and 4,270 respondents, respectively. We differentiated the most loyal Trump supporters from the rest of the American population, including those who merely voted for Trump and supported his policies, by measuring three aspects of Trump support: unquestioning credulity, exemplified by the belief that he was in fact the legitimate winner of the 2020 election; belief in Trump\u2019s leadership abilities; and belief in his elevated stature\u2014a status frequently disrespected by the mainstream media. Strong Trump supporters comprise around 10 and 6 percent of the people in the two studies, respectively 33 and 13 percent of all Republicans.\n\nTo measure their personalities, we employed psychologists\u2019 \u201cBig Five\u201d personality dimensions: agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism and openness (or open-mindedness). Positions along these five dimensions predict political behavior well, even rivaling education and income as predictors. We asked whether Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters share personality traits and to what extent these are traits one might expect to find among cult members.\n\nMost strikingly, we find they are highly conscientious, a measure of self-reported characteristics including carefulness, dependability, orderliness and self-discipline. Conscientiousness is significantly associated with all the three cultlike aspects of Trump support. High conscientiousness appears in those believing that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen,\u201d in Trump\u2019s outstanding leadership abilities and in his high status among other U.S. presidents.\n\nIt is particularly on the self-discipline facet of conscientiousness (self-reported qualities of being focused, reliable, hard-working, and persevering), not the order facet (high self-reported qualities of being careful and organized), where these Trump supporters get distinctly high scores. Here we see a difference between Trump loyalists and conservatives, as conservatism is associated with the order facet only, according to the most recent research. High self-discipline is found also in Trump loyalists who do not identify as conservative or Republican. Other Trump supporters do not share these personality characteristics of his most loyal supporters.\n\nWith a view of Trump supporters as a personality cult, it is not surprising that they possess self-images that include a high level of self-discipline. Cult members show stable, disciplined loyalty to their leader and their cult. The opportunity to follow a strong leader provides followers with pronouncements, actions and beliefs to which they can adhere in a disciplined way. While conservatives value social stability and order, cult members can favor destabilizing acts like the storming of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat does this mean for U.S. politics? Devoted support for Trump demonstrates how political behavior need not be based on policy preferences or ideology. It might instead be motivated by psychological needs found in individuals seeking the guidance of strong leadership. Loyal Trump supporters put their faith in a strong leader they believe can effectively solve problems and save their country from internal and external threats. They find assurance in a leader boasting \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d\n\nWe suggest Trump\u2019s political success springs from this psychological wellspring. His cult enables him to shape conservative news coverage, since his followers are among its most avid consumers and will move away from voices critical of Trump. Trump\u2019s cult also enables him to effectively wield endorsements in primaries to either uplift or defeat other Republicans, based on their fealty. This helped him shape the GOP field in the 2022 midterms through over 200 endorsements. Numerous other U.S. politicians have also adopted positions from protectionism to anti-Washington populism and white nationalism, but it is not these policies that are the key to Trump\u2019s success. We contend that Trump has what others have lacked: a highly loyal and motivated base of supporters\u2014his personality cult.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.",

      "title": "Politics Report: Bill Walton, a Civic Obituary",
      "news": "Five years ago, before the pandemic, before that hellish year of 2020, a couple colleagues of mine and I visited Bill Walton at his home for breakfast. After we arrived, a worker pointed us to the garage where he was working out.\n\nHe knew me and our work but my mission that day was to help him understand it better and, ideally, get him to publicly endorse it, maybe make a video for us. He was San Diego\u2019s most famous resident until he died, Monday, at age 71 from colon cancer nobody I have talked to knew he had.\n\nGetting a nod from him, a video we could send out maybe, would be worth far more than just a donation from him. He was not just a famous person who lived here \u2014 he represented San Diego\u2019s sunny soul. An endorsement from Walton had no downside \u2013 he was not controversial at all. He supported political candidates but in a way that also managed to be apolitical. In 2015, we sat together at a banquet celebrating 100 years since the Panama-California Exposition made Balboa Park what it is. I asked him if he would ever consider running for mayor. He demurred, mumbling something about not being able to.\n\nHis wife, Lori, told me to stop asking him. They could not afford it, she said, with a look of deadly seriousness. He needed to work and was content to support political leaders when they were doing something he believed was positive and productive.\n\nI wanted Voice to be part of his collection of beloved San Diego institutions.\n\nIt was an easy sell but a very interesting breakfast. As we ate, he told me he believed San Diego leaders should strive for the city to be known for three things worldwide: solar power, bicycling and cannabis.\n\nI told him that was an amazing quote that I would like to use. It would have made a simple headline and a post on our site with unquestionably wide reach. I asked if I could quote him.\n\nHe sat silent for a moment and said no. He still was a broadcaster, a color commentator, of the most colorful variety possible, for NBA and college basketball games. He said he believed his corporate employers were not ready for him to openly endorse cannabis use.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop myself from laughing. Imagine being scandalized upon learning Bill Walton enjoyed cannabis. He was recognizable with his seven-foot frame and wide wingspan at Grateful Dead and Phish shows across the country. I regretted not leaning in more and getting high and spending the day with him talking over San Diego\u2019s problems and possibilities.\n\nBill Walton at his home with former Voice director of development Iris Magid, board member Bill Osborne and Scott Lewis in August, 2019.\n\nHe became a diligent reader. Once he wrote to one of our board members \u201cI love, and live for VOSD, please let me know how I can ever help \u2026 we will survive, we are alive, shine on, heal on, teach on, carry on, thank you, BW, Bill Walton.\u201d\n\nHe was relentlessly positive. Even when he was endorsing what we do, which isn\u2019t always positive, he put a positive twist on it. \u201cWe\u2019ll never learn what we don\u2019t want to know,\u201d he said.\n\nWalton didn\u2019t just go to the big fancy banquets or the chicken dinners and award ceremonies, he would go to City Heights for the opening of a basketball court or to a community leader\u2019s funeral, carrying around his tall chair, his only relief from the chronic pain he suffered.\n\nFormer San Diego City Councilmember Marti Emerald recalled how he brought that enthusiasm to the push for a new Central Library downtown. He testified four separate times to the City Council advocating for approval for the project. It was never a given they would support it, especially as the Council balked at a hefty gap between what it would cost to build and how much money it had raised. His mother was a librarian. He wasn\u2019t going to give it up.\n\nFinally, when philanthropist Irwin Jacobs stepped up to close the gap, it still wasn\u2019t clear they would get the votes. Walton helped put it over.\n\n\u201cHe made the most of his celebrity and standing to help others. He never did anything just to be seen. He was there, often quietly, just to provide support,\u201d she said. \u201cThe common link was kids. He was always there to support anything that would meaningfully show kids that they could achieve anything they wanted.\u201d\n\nHe was always there to support Mel Katz, a relentless civic advocate himself and one of the main reasons the library was built. Walton clearly believed Katz had the right compass, once telling me that he would do whatever Katz asked him.\n\n\u201cHe loved San Diego, working people and progressive causes,\u201d Katz said.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the only contentious causes Walton had weighed in on were the ill-fated redesign of Balboa Park that Jacobs proposed and worked relentlessly to implement and the ballot initiative for a higher minimum wage in the city of San Diego. Even then, nobody ever fought with Walton \u2013 if he had adopted it as one of his causes, that was just something opponents had to accept.\n\nSomething happened, though, after the pandemic. Like everyone, it had isolated him. The giant man who loved concerts, big basketball games and people, and who needed to keep working, lost all of it. In the year after the pandemic began, downtown San Diego and Balboa Park went from vibrant fun places to dystopian hellscapes. It felt like a bomb had gone off downtown, as businesses closed and temporary Covid testing sites popped up.\n\nJails stopped taking minor offenders and let others out. Homeless shelters had to clear out. Tens of thousands of people were newly unemployed and traumatized. A new mayoral administration had taken over with a new approach to homelessness and the crisis became more disturbing and ugly than ever. Something had happened on one of Walton\u2019s bike rides and he started getting frustrated with the homelessness crisis.\n\nI heard he began sending Mayor Todd Gloria, whom he had supported, a series of increasingly hostile emails. When I finally got them, I was shocked. They had the most negative and acrimonious statements I had ever seen Walton make. Despite our rapport, I had trouble getting him to confirm the emails were his and when I finally did, he didn\u2019t want to discuss it.\n\n\u201conce again, while peacefully riding my bike early this Sunday morning in Balboa Park, I was threatened, chased, and assaulted by the homeless population, in our Park,\u201d he wrote Aug. 28, 2022, to Mayor Gloria.\n\n\u201conce again, you\u2019ve done, and continue to do, nothing.\u201d\n\nHis liberalism and kindness had shifted to a desire for something of a crackdown on homeless residents \u201cwho are allowed to disregard the rules.\u201d\n\nFormer NBA Star Bill Walton (left), Executive Committee Member, Dan Shea, (center) Lucky Duck Foundation and Executive Director Drew Moser (right) speak at a press conference at the University of San Diego Institute for Peace and Justice Theatre at the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace Studies on Sept. 27, 2022. / Photo by Ariana Drehsler\n\nGloria\u2019s staff took Walton on and the feud became increasingly personal. In a notorious press event at University of San Diego, Walton said Gloria should resign as mayor.\n\n\u201cOur neighborhood is under siege,\u201d Walton said Tuesday, referencing a homeless camp in a corner of Balboa Park close to his Hillcrest home. \u201cEverything in our lives is dictated by the homeless.\u201d\n\nHe took to calling homeless encampments \u201cGloriavilles\u201d and encouraged others to do it as well as he demanded the crisis attract an urgent response.\n\n\u201cHe never expressed a lack of compassion for the people on the street who had no other options. His focus was on the lack of prosecution of the criminal element,\u201d said Dan Shea, an executive committee member of the Lucky Duck Foundation, who had dove into the homelessness crisis in 2017 in partnership with the late Padres Chairman Peter Seidler. Shea was at Walton\u2019s side when the relentless San Diego booster became Gloria\u2019s toughest foe.\n\n\u201cWe deserve clarity on what he was pissed off about. He wanted to see real progress on the crisis \u2014 help for the people who needed it and enforcement of law on people who preyed on them. Instead of just moving them around town until someone complained enough to move them again,\u201d Shea said.\n\nFor other longtime friends of Walton, it was hard.\n\n\u201cHe was doing the only thing he thought he could do,\u201d Katz said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was realistic about how big the problem is and how difficult it was to address.\u201d\n\nWalton eventually went so far as to say he couldn\u2019t recommend people visit San Diego or build lives and businesses here. It was a shocking shift in tone from San Diego\u2019s son, its biggest star and its biggest booster. Gloria pushed for a ban on encampments, more explicit than ones that already existed, arguably in part because of the pressure Walton helped mount but Walton never relented. He began advocating for Sunbreak Ranch, an idea to put a large camp somewhere to house all homeless people and provide services and more forcibly disallow them on city streets and public spaces.\n\nWhen Walton died last week, several people noted Gloria did not put a post on X. Gloria had sent out a simple statement \u2013 much shorter than former President Barack Obama\u2019s \u2013 but about how his thoughts were with the family.\n\nI asked Gloria to speak a bit more on it.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to see the problem dealt with yesterday and I agree. I am impatient too. He was always a fairly patient person and an easy-going fellow and this issue frustrated him and he saw it only getting worse. I agreed with him and lot of San Diegans but there were just no simple solutions,\u201d Gloria told me.\n\nThere were no simple solutions, even the simplest, Sunbreak Ranch, is unfathomably complex and expensive and little more than a dream still. But people on all sides of the issue, perceived the same thing Walton did: That Gloria was not treating the issue with the sense of emergency it demanded. It was a complex civic problem the city was slowly chipping away at, not a humanitarian emergency.\n\n\u201cAsk Todd Gloria why he won\u2019t utilize all the public resources, facilities and properties to provide the immediate shelter, the food and the rehabilitative services that our homeless population needs and deserves now,\u201d Walton said in a video last year.\n\nIt was jarring, it wasn\u2019t entirely productive, but Walton\u2019s rants were as San Diegan as his sunny and spiritual boosterism had been in the years before. He was still articulating the essence of San Diego, which was still vaguely liberal, still interested in bicycling and cannabis, but disgusted by what was happening and confused why it couldn\u2019t be more forcefully and immediately addressed.\n\nAnd like many, he was worried we had lost something, we had lost what we loved about the city.\n\nThe homelessness crisis does not seem to be improving. Officials last week spun ever-worsening numbers as a hopeful sign just because the problem is at least getting worse more slowly than before.\n\nIt was just not the kind of thing even San Diego\u2019s greatest booster ever could champion.\n\nOnly One Finalist Stood at End of Contentious County CAO Search\n\nThis week, the chair of the Board of Supervisors, Nora Vargas, made it official that she and all four of her colleagues had, as we reported last week, offered the job of chief administrative officer overseeing 18,000 county employees to Ebony Shelton, the current chief financial officer. She will be the first Black woman to lead the county and her financial expertise will come in handy immediately as the county braces for state budget cuts.\n\nThe Board will make it official Tuesday.\n\nIn the Union-Tribune story about the appointment, Vargas subtly sent a dig at her critics pointing out that all the supervisors had supported the process they went through and then there was this sentence:\n\n\u201cFinalists were also interviewed by a panel of 10 community members \u2014 two from each supervisorial district \u2014 who provided feedback to the board on the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate,\u201d the paper wrote.\n\nThat\u2019s not true: Yes, each of the five supervisors appointed two community members to interview the finalists. Yes, they met Monday May 27 via Zoom to do that. However, I have confirmed via several of them that they did not find out until that meeting that they would only be interviewing one candidate. The search firm and the supervisors had decided to only send them two candidates: Shelton and another from outside San Diego.\n\nBut the one from outside the county dropped out. They interviewed Shelton but there was no official feedback provided to the Board of Supervisors about her from the panel.\n\nIf you have any ideas or feedback for the Politics Report, send them to scott.lewis@voiceofsandiego.org.",

      "title": "Why Trump\u2019s Conviction Does Not Complicate My Abolitionist Politics",
      "news": "I was walking to the grocery store on Thursday when an elated driver yelled out their car window at me, \u201cTrump is guilty!\u201d That is how I learned that former president Donald Trump had been convicted of 34 felony charges.\n\nAs I continued to walk down the street, I was greeted by a woman who was raising an American flag outside her home. \u201cTrump\u2019s a felon!\u201d she declared.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve heard,\u201d I said.\n\nShe went on to explain that she had raised the flag on her porch on 9/11 and on the day Richard Nixon resigned, and that she was raising it again today.\n\nAs my group chats reacted to the news that Trump had been found guilty with jokes and questions about what comes next, a friend said to me, \u201cI guess you were wrong.\u201d\n\nPuzzled, I asked, \u201cWhat was I wrong about?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat he would be convicted,\u201d she said.\n\nI had to remind her that I never took a position on the outcome of the trial. I know as well as anyone that juries are unpredictable, and that Trump is undoubtedly guilty of many crimes. I have, however, previously stated that I don\u2019t believe Trump is going to prison because prisons simply don\u2019t exist to house men like him. I still believe that he is unlikely to spend time in prison, and a number of legal experts agree, but ultimately, predictions about whether Trump is eventually incarcerated are not the point.\n\nMy biggest concern when people are celebrating high-profile convictions is typically that those verdicts offer false reassurances that the injustice system \u201cworks,\u201d and that carcerality can save us.\n\nI saw a post on Bluesky on Thursday in which someone lamented that it was a hard day to be a prison abolitionist. I am not sure if they meant that it was a hard day because there was a part of them that wanted to celebrate alongside other posters, or whether it was hard for them to see the term \u201cfelon\u201d bandied about as though it were proof of someone\u2019s inferiority or unworthiness. Perhaps it was difficult to see people raising a glass to the system and declaring that \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d I couldn\u2019t say. My biggest concern when people are celebrating high-profile convictions is typically that those verdicts offer false reassurances that the injustice system \u201cworks,\u201d and that carcerality can save us.\n\nIt\u2019s true that most people with felony convictions do not deserve to be associated with Trump, or to be depicted as fundamentally undeserving of care and consideration. However, I doubt there will be any dissuading people from throwing the word \u201cfelon\u201d around in the coming months, as though it has the power to cast a hex on Trump\u2019s name that the words rapist, white supremacist and fascist (all of which clearly apply to him) have not. People whose political lives are limited to the act of voting and yelling at people about voting tend to flex their worst qualities during election years. \u2018Tis the season.\n\nIn moments like this one, a lot of people who identify as prison abolitionists try to carve out exceptions. They may say things like, \u201cI am a prison abolitionist, but\u2026\u201d before explaining why they are savoring a particular conviction. I will admit that there are moments when I have conflicted feelings, in the wake of a guilty verdict. Those feelings are human. They are not the result of a sudden flurry of faith in the system, or of a belief that a torturous system that manufactures premature death for millions of people is occasionally worthwhile. Those moments when my emotions do not necessarily align with my beliefs are the product of a basic desire to see something ugly to happen to someone who has caused great harm. They are vengeful emotions born of a desire for satisfaction. In my politics, I do not equate justice with satisfaction, nor do I believe my knee-jerk emotions should dictate people\u2019s fates.\n\nWhen I think about whether prison is \u201cjustice,\u201d I am not thinking about wealth-anointed politicians and celebrities. I am thinking about the people that prison was created to target and disappear from society.\n\nWhen I think about whether prison is \u201cjustice,\u201d I am not thinking about wealth-anointed politicians and celebrities. I am thinking about the people that prison was created to target and disappear from society, people who are being sexually assaulted, deprived of potable drinking water, functional medical care, and even sunlight. Police and prisons maintain the power and property of the ruling class, and serve as disposal systems for people who serve no economic purpose under capitalism. While some people entertain fantasies that the wealthy might be equally subject to carceral horrors, capitalists propel us toward global annihilation and lobby for the criminalization of homelessness.\n\nWhen I talk about criminalization, abolition and Trump\u2019s legal woes, I am not focused on the former president\u2019s well-being. As an organizer, I am concerned with how people make sense of the world and how high-profile cases figure into that sense-making. I also don\u2019t begrudge people their schadenfreude when a man as horrible as Trump has a very bad day. When Trump had COVID, I rooted for the virus. As someone who is deeply worried about Trump\u2019s transphobic, ethno-nationalist politics, I am concerned that people will assume his conviction, and their avid use of the word \u201cfelon,\u201d will shape people\u2019s electoral decisions.\n\nThe people who are inclined to vote for Trump have been further galvanized by this verdict. They see the legal attacks on Trump as evidence that they, their beliefs, and their position in this society are under attack and must be fought for. They are more likely to show up to the polls and more likely to commit acts of violence in Trump\u2019s name. I am not suggesting that our actions should be guided by right-wing threats of reprisal \u2014 merely that we should be realistic about the right\u2019s well-established potential for violence.\n\nWhile this moment has generated satisfaction for many, the terrain of injustice we are navigating remains unchanged. As my friend, author Sarah Kendzior, told me after the verdict, \u201cThe victims of Trump\u2019s decades of crimes \u2014 everyday Americans \u2014 are no safer than they were before yesterday, nor have there been any meaningful consequences for Trump.\u201d Sarah pointed out that the most immediate consequences of this trial could befall the presiding judge or members of the jury. \u201cThat is yet another indicator that we live in a mafia state, which is nothing to celebrate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a mafia state under Trump, and it remains a mafia state under Biden, and the seeds of corruption were sown long before either of them entered office.\u201d\n\nWhile this moment has generated satisfaction for many, the terrain of injustice we are navigating remains unchanged.\n\nWe live in a country that is currently facilitating the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. Among those who rule us, and those who are poised to do so, there is no moral high ground to fight over. I have no desire to experience a Trump presidency, but do I see any moral redemption for the United States in his conviction? As Sarah told me, \u201cWe are in a situation where the government has neither moral nor solid legal standing.\u201d\n\nRegardless of my disgust for Joe Biden, and the political machinations of both major parties, I have no desire to live through another Trump presidency. Even without a conviction, Trump has clearly demonstrated his ability to sanction the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and dismantle the living conditions of many, many more. Trouncing him in the polls should not be a difficult task. However, Biden has chosen to fund and support a genocide. Would-be voters are watching people burn alive in their tents and staring at images of children ripped apart by bombs. The psychological damage of watching a father collect the pieces of his child\u2019s severed body is not undone by calling Trump a \u201cfelon.\u201d\n\nWhat is the political power of criminalization in an election year when President Biden is indifferent to an order from the International Court of Justice declaring that Israel must halt its offensive in Rafah \u201cin conformity with its obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide\u201d? Given that we are faced with two candidates who fully support the crime of genocide, there is no moral reckoning to be found in the resolution of a case about falsified documents and the coverup of scandalous sexual encounters. Unfortunately, we are accustomed to equating satisfaction with justice in this country, and demanding far too little in the way of transformation.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Truthout.

      "news": "CNN \u2014\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland is expected to slam the \u201crepeated attacks\u201d and \u201cconspiracy\u201d theories floated by Republicans about the Justice Department being weaponized against former President Donald Trump during his opening statements to Congress on Tuesday, according to prepared remarks shared with CNN.\n\nGarland\u2019s forceful defense of the department and federal law enforcement will begin what is likely to be a tense, hours-long hearing before members of the House Judiciary Committee. The hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 am ET.\n\nIn his most explicit comments since his confirmation in 2020, Garland will tell members of the House Judiciary Committee that recent attacks on the Justice Department \u201care unprecedented and unfounded.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertain members of this Committee and the Oversight Committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining \u2013 for no legitimate purpose \u2013 sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations,\u201d Garland will say, according to the prepared remarks.\n\nThe attorney general was called to Capitol Hill for a hearing on the department\u2019s work under his leadership, including efforts to combat violent crime and investigate potential threats to the US stemming from conflicts abroad.\n\nBut Garland, who is at the center of Republican-led contempt proceedings, is prepared to forcefully push back against his critics.\n\nRepublicans are moving to try to hold Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio tapes of the president\u2019s interview with special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated his handling of classified material and declined to bring charges.\n\nThe contempt proceedings come \u201calongside false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local District Attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department,\u201d Garland will say according to his remarks, referring to the New York state trial in which Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records.\n\n\u201cThat conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\u201d Garland is expected to say.\n\nIn a letter to Garland ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, House GOP Reps. Chip Roy, Andy Biggs and Thomas Massie accused the Justice Department of \u201caggressive prosecutions of American citizens who were present\u201d at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and demanded a briefing on the matter.\n\nThe attorney general will also allude to other threats stemming from the federal Trump investigations, including \u201cextremely dangerous falsehoods\u201d being spread about the FBI\u2019s law enforcement operations and \u201cthreats to defund particular Department investigations\u201d like that of special counsel Jack Smith.\n\n\u201cIt comes at a time when we are seeing heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department\u2019s career public servants,\u201d Garland is expected to say. But the long line of attacks \u201chave not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\u201d\n\n\u201cI view contempt as a serious matter. But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations,\u201d Garland\u2019s remarks say.\n\n\u201cI will not be intimidated. And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Why Biden and Trump struggle to make gains when the other stumbles",
      "news": "CNN \u2014\n\nEven after former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction last week on 34 felony counts, he and President Joe Biden remain stuck in a strikingly similar strategic position: Neither man can win without attracting a significant sliver of voters who dislike them but may be even more alienated from their opponent.\n\nWhile the guilty verdict in Trump\u2019s hush money trial seems likely to further weaken his already tenuous standing with voters, by itself it\u2019s unlikely to strengthen Biden\u2019s own precarious position with the public. That means the election will likely pivot on whether more voters in the key states place greater weight on their doubts about Trump or on their concerns about Biden.\n\n\u201cGiven the unpopularity of both of these candidates, I think either candidate can win with a negative rating substantially higher than their positive rating,\u201d said longtime Republican pollster Whit Ayres.\n\nPolling shows that Biden and Trump alike are winning support from an unusually large number of voters who express reservations about them \u2014 largely because they consider the alternative even more unpalatable.\n\nBiden in polls, for instance, is winning a much greater share of voters who disapprove of his performance as president than any other incumbent seeking reelection in recent times. During their reelection bids, Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2020 each won only 3% of voters who said they disapproved of their job performance, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. George W. Bush won only 6% of his disapprovers in his 2004 reelection, the exit polls found.\n\nBut as for Biden, the latest Marist/NPR/PBS NewsHour poll released last week is typical: It found that 15% of voters who disapprove of his performance say they will vote for him anyway. That extends the pattern from the 2022 midterm election, when an unusually high 12% of voters who disapproved of Biden voted for Democratic House candidates, and even higher percentages of Biden disapprovers voted for Democrats in such key statewide races as the Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin gubernatorial contests, according to the exit polls.\n\nVoters who say they \u201cstrongly\u201d disapprove of Biden voted overwhelmingly for Republicans in 2022, and in the latest Marist survey, Trump drew over 9 in 10 of them. That\u2019s standard: Voters who strongly disapprove of a president\u2019s performance always vote overwhelmingly against him or his party.\n\nBut House Democrats way overperformed in 2022 among the voters who said they \u201csomewhat\u201d disapproved of Biden. (They won 49% of them, far more than the roughly one-third House Republicans captured in 2018 from voters who somewhat disapproved of Trump.) And in the new Marist survey, Biden, stunningly, draws 55% of the vote against Trump from voters who somewhat disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. (The latest national Marquette Law School poll, released in late May, also showed Biden drawing 53% of voters who somewhat disapproved of his performance.) By contrast, in their reelection campaigns, Trump and Obama both won fewer than 1 in 10 of the voters who somewhat disapproved of their performance, while Bush won fewer than 1 in 5 of them, the exit polls found.\n\nWhen people ask whether anything hurts Trump, Biden\u2019s showing among voters who somewhat disapprove of his performance points toward the answer. All the controversies swirling around Trump do hurt him, in a way that can be tangibly measured. In the new Marist poll, Biden\u2019s share of the vote against Trump in a two-way matchup is 10 points higher than Biden\u2019s own approval rating among men who identify as independents, 14 points higher among college-educated White women, 15 points higher among members of Generation Z and millennials, and 21 points higher among independent women. That\u2019s extraordinary for an incumbent president whose approval rating, for better or worse, is usually the north star of his reelection campaign.\n\nThose results represent millions of voters who are down on Biden\u2019s performance, frustrated by inflation and, in many instances, worried he\u2019s too old for the job, but who are planning to vote for him anyway because they consider Trump unfit or dangerous. Biden\u2019s problem is that while there is a large pool of voters willing to make that calculation, it is not an infinite one.\n\nConflicted voters would be much more likely to push Biden over the top if he had a stronger foundation of Americans genuinely pleased with his record. Late last year, many Democrats hoped that steady improvement in inflation, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board and a quick end to the fighting in Gaza might raise Biden\u2019s approval rating. But none of those events has occurred. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that events are lifting [Biden], and there\u2019s no evidence that the campaign is lifting him,\u201d said Bill Kristol, a longtime conservative strategist who has become a prominent Trump critic.\n\nThe share of voters who view Biden\u2019s performance positively remains stuck at an ominously low level. Biden\u2019s approval rating is usually reaching only about 40% in most polls. That puts him just slightly higher than the Gallup approval ratings for Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush in the final months before their respective reelection defeats in 1980 and 1992 and slightly lower than Trump\u2019s in the final quarterly Gallup average before his defeat in 2020. The presidents reelected since World War II all had significantly higher Gallup approval ratings than Biden late in their first terms.\n\nSo long as so few voters view Biden\u2019s performance positively, he will remain vulnerable to Trump, no matter how many doubts voters hold about the former president, many strategists in both parties agree.\n\nIn fact, polls show Trump also benefiting from the lesser-of-two-evils dynamic boosting Biden. Presidential candidates typically win only minimal support from voters who view them unfavorably: Trump in 2020 and GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, for instance, won just 5% of voters who expressed unfavorable opinions about them, the exit polls found. But last month\u2019s Marquette survey found that in the rematch with Biden, Trump is winning 17% of the voters who view him unfavorably; he was winning 12% in the Marist poll. That range puts Trump more in line with the unusually large share he won among voters who viewed him unfavorably during his successful 2016 race against Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn results averaged over the two most recent national Marquette polls, a solid majority of voters agreed that Trump has behaved corruptly. But about one-third of those who described Trump as corrupt said they intend to vote for him anyway, according to unpublished results provided by poll director Charles Franklin. One reason for that: More than 90% of the voters who are voting for Trump even though they believe he has behaved corruptly also disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president.\n\nEach man\u2019s vulnerabilities, in other words, is blunting the impact of the other\u2019s. Ayres predicts the electoral consequence of Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cis going to be minimized\u201d because \u201cmost Americans don\u2019t think Joe Biden is able to serve effectively in a second term\u201d and are angry at him over the cost of living. But those acute Biden vulnerabilities, Ayres continued, are not dooming his campaign \u201cbecause he\u2019s running against a convicted felon\u201d who has alienated large swathes of the electorate on other grounds as well.\n\nRepublican pollster Greg Strimple believes voters have already decided whose deficiencies concern them most: Biden. Recently, Strimple and a Democratic partner polled the seven most competitive swing states for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. The poll showed Trump leading in each state except Wisconsin, where the two men were tied. As important, Strimple said, was a series of questions in which the pollsters asked voters whether they were more concerned about a potential vulnerability of Trump\u2019s or Biden\u2019s. Each time, Strimple noted, a greater number said the potential Biden liability worried them most \u2014 with more, for instance, saying they worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity than about Trump\u2019s temperament and legal problems.\n\n\u201cThe most fascinating thing about the survey was even if people believe something bad about Trump, they were still voting for him,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cThat is a strength of Trump\u2019s, but it\u2019s really the weakness of Biden that is propelling Trump.\u201d\n\nStrimple expressed more confidence about a Trump victory than any Republican outside his campaign whom I have spoken with this year. That\u2019s not because he thinks voters have especially opened to Trump since 2020, but because he believes they have closed the book on Biden, just as they did in the final months of the presidencies of Carter in 1980 and H.W. Bush in 1992. Biden \u201ccan\u2019t change inflation and he can\u2019t change the fact that he is really old,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cIf I am sitting there in the war room of campaign Biden, I am like, \u2018How can I fix two things that are unfixable?\u2019\u201d\n\nLongtime Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg sees the race in almost exactly the opposite terms. Rosenberg, who was the most prominent Democrat predicting that the widely anticipated red wave would fizzle in 2022, believes the vulnerabilities of Trump and his MAGA movement are so insurmountable that they eventually will overwhelm voters\u2019 doubts about Biden.\n\nRosenberg leans heavily on the precedent of 2022. Though Republicans rolled to big victories in red-leaning states, he noted, Democrats vastly exceeded expectations by winning the gubernatorial races in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Those victories, he said, have created a template for Democrats to exploit the resistance to Trump\u2019s agenda in enough swing states to reach 270 Electoral College votes this year.\n\n\u201cWe know what happens when we go in with lots of money and a big campaign and talk about MAGA to swing-state voters: We win and they lose,\u201d he said. \u201cIf MAGA in 2024 is even more extreme and more dangerous \u2026 that is just the more likely scenario of what happens then the alternative.\u201d\n\nRosenberg would prefer if more voters held positive views about Biden, but he insists it\u2019s not necessary for the president to win because the \u201cconstant dynamic\u201d in our politics since 2018 has become opposition to Trump and MAGA. \u201cWho the Democratic candidate is is to some degree immaterial,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cBecause this has been a pattern that has repeated again and again and again\u201d in the statewide races across the battlegrounds \u201cregardless of who the Democratic candidate has been.\u201d\n\nMichael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, views the campaign, in effect, as a competition between these perspectives. He wrote last week that the level and nature of turnout will likely be shaped by whether the public debate in the race\u2019s final weeks focuses more on Biden\u2019s problems or Trump\u2019s.\n\n\u201cSince 2016, whenever an election has been \u2018about\u2019 MAGA, turnout rates have been much higher than normal, and Democrats have won much more often in those contests,\u201d Podhorzer wrote. \u201cIf the Trump and MAGA agenda is salient in October, I am confident turnout will again be at historic highs and that Biden will do as well or better than he did in 2020. But if the economy, immigration, or a similar issue is center stage, turnout levels will be lower, as will Biden\u2019s prospects for an Electoral College victory.\u201d\n\nPodhorzer views Trump\u2019s conviction as necessary but not sufficient to shift the focus among swing voters from their discontents with the president back toward their hesitations about Trump. \u201cThe effect of the conviction shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated in a time where, by itself, no one thing can change the race,\u201d Podhorzer wrote in an email. \u201cBut it is very much characteristic of the kind of events that remind voters of how dangerous a second Trump term would be.\u201d\n\nOn balance, history suggests there is more reason for concern among Democrats than Republicans in this pattern of offsetting weakness. In 1980, Carter successfully raised many doubts about his challenger, Ronald Reagan, just as H.W. Bush did about his challenger, Bill Clinton, in 1992. Yet neither Carter nor Bush could escape the gravitational pull of their own very low approval ratings and were soundly defeated. Voters who really dislike the status quo will almost always find ways to rationalize voting for change \u2014 no matter how risky that change appears. When people are deeply dissatisfied with conditions in the country, as I wrote during that 1992 campaign, stability seems to them the real risk.\n\nStill, Trump is a different kind of challenger from Reagan or Clinton. Because neither had held federal office, it was easier for both men to function as a relatively blank screen on which voters projected their hopes. By contrast, because Trump has been president already, voters have more fully formed opinions of what it would mean to return him to the Oval Office.\n\nSo far in the 2024 race, that dynamic has largely advantaged Trump. His retrospective job approval in most surveys has been improving \u2014 often to a higher level than at any point during his presidency. That\u2019s largely because voters\u2019 discontent over inflation (and to a lesser extent border security) under Biden is causing them to weigh Trump\u2019s record on those issues more heavily when judging his overall record.\n\nA major danger to Trump from the conviction in New York, as Podhorzer suggests, may be that it begins a process of reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 the chaos, division and unpredictability. Whatever the immediate effect of the verdict on the race, the prospect of electing a convicted felon as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and commander in chief may weigh more heavily on Americans as the election approaches. At a time when Trump is relying to an unusual degree on irregular voters who don\u2019t tend to follow current events, news of his conviction may come as a surprise and \u201cremind them of what he is really like,\u201d said Danielle Deiseroth, executive director of Data for Progress, a liberal polling firm that last week published a major survey of swing voters.\n\n\u201cI think there are going to be a lot of voters out there who voted in 2020 and don\u2019t like either candidate and stay home,\u201d she added. \u201cOr they might say, \u2018I\u2019d rather vote for the guy who is not a convicted felon.\u2019\u201d\n\nVoters\u2019 reservations about Trump and Biden help explain why the presidential race has seemed so static for months. The doubts each man faces place a ceiling on his support that limits his gains when the other stumbles \u2014 a pattern that seems more likely to be confirmed than confounded by Trump\u2019s unprecedented conviction.\n\nAgainst a stronger Democrat, Ayres believes, last week\u2019s guilty verdict would likely be fatal; but against a stronger Republican, he noted, so would the concerns about Biden\u2019s performance and age. The winner in this rematch between two weakened combatants will likely be the candidate who can focus more voters on his rival\u2019s vulnerabilities than his own.",

      "news": "Government spokesman slams right and far-right parties for going after Begona Gomez.\n\nA Spanish court has summoned the wife of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez as part of a corruption investigation that the government has denounced as a political hit job.\n\nBegona Gomez is to appear in court on July 5 to answer questions about allegations that she used her position to influence business deals, a Madrid-based court said on Tuesday.\n\nGomez has yet to publicly address the case, but Sanchez has called it a \u201csmear campaign\u201d to damage the leftist coalition government led by his Socialist Workers\u2019 Party.\n\nSpanish government spokeswoman Pilar Alegria told reporters on Tuesday that the probe involving Gomez is based on \u201clies and disinformation\u201d and the government knows \u201cthere is absolutely nothing here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we have here is a mudslinging campaign by the right and the far right, the Popular Party and Vox,\u201d she said after the weekly cabinet meeting.\n\nThe investigation is based on allegations brought by a group called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands.\n\nThe group has pursued legal cases, many of which have been linked to right-wing causes and have targeted leftist politicians. Manos Limpias, which has seen many of its lawsuits against politicians fail, has said its complaint is based on media reports.\n\nAfter the probe was launched in April, the prime minister took the unprecedented step of saying he would halt his public duties to contemplate whether he would step down from his post.\n\nAfter five days of silence, Sanchez said during an address that he decided to stay on as prime minister and continue \u201cwith even more strength\u201d.\n\nSpanish public prosecutors had sought to dismiss the probe, but a provincial court ruled that the lower court judge could continue the investigation. The judge can now either suspend the corruption probe or recommend the case go to trial.\n\nThe announcement of Gomez\u2019s summons was made days before voting begins in elections to choose the next European Parliament.

      "news": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, national political reporters Bridget Bowman and Henry J.

Gomez\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s guilty verdict in his New York hush money case is turning into one of the first major tests for candidates in key down-ballot races trying to navigate the tumult of running alongside the polarizing former president.\n\nRepublican candidates across Senate battlegrounds rallied around Trump after a Manhattan jury found him guilty last week on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, with many criticizing the case as \u201celection interference,\u201d \u201ca sham,\u201d \u201crigged\u201d and \u201cpolitical persecution.\u201d\n\nYet, while Republicans are rushing to embrace Trump, many Democrats want to focus on their own states and other issues instead of making a meal out of the guilty verdict, facing an uncertain political landscape and the knowledge that they\u2019ll need Trump voters to back them, too, in critical races.\n\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\n\nAt least two Republican Senate candidates began running new ads Monday looking to further leverage the verdict.\n\nIn Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy released a new spot saying his likely opponent in the Senate race, Jon Tester, the Democratic incumbent, \u201csupported Joe Biden\u2019s witch hunt every step of the way.\u201d The ad will air on TV, according to a source familiar with the strategy.\n\nIn Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno launched a digital ad that criticizes Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown for \u201crefusing to condemn Biden\u2019s politically motivated witch hunt.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that Moreno and Sheehy are leaning into the verdict to fire up Trump\u2019s supporters in Ohio and Montana. Both states are among Republicans\u2019 best opportunities to flip Senate seats this year, after an open seat in West Virginia \u2014 Trump carried Montana by 16 points and Ohio by 8 points in 2020. The GOP needs a net gain of two seats to take control of the Senate (or one seat if Trump wins the White House, because the vice president casts tiebreaking votes in the Senate).\n\nTester and Brown had similar, muted responses to last week\u2019s verdict.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer or a judge but I\u2019ve said from the beginning that no one is above the law,\u201d Brown said in a statement. \u201cUltimately this is up to the legal system to sort out and for the American people to decide in November.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator Tester respects the judicial process and believes everyone should be treated fairly before the courts, and voters will have the opportunity to make their voices heard at the ballot box in November,\u201d a spokesperson told the Montana Free Press.\n\nRead more on how Senate candidates are handling the Trump verdict \u2192\n\nWhat the first polls after Trump\u2019s conviction show \u2014 and don\u2019t show\n\nBy Mark Murray\n\nNews organizations and pollsters released multiple snap surveys over the weekend to gauge the political landscape after Trump\u2019s conviction.\n\nHere are three takeaways from what the different national surveys told us \u2014 and didn\u2019t tell us \u2014 after the historic verdict.\n\nMajorities agree with the verdict: A CBS News/YouGov poll found that 57% of adults said the jury in Trump\u2019s trial reached the correct verdict. That finding was backed up by a Morning Consult poll, in which 54% of registered voters said they approved of the verdict, as well as an ABC News/Ipsos survey, in which 50% of adults said the verdict was correct.\n\nThose results are in line with pre-verdict national polls, which consistently showed slight majorities saying that the charges against Trump were serious and that he was being held to the same standard as anyone else accused of those crimes.\n\nRepublicans remain firmly behind Trump: The headline of a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Saturday stated that 1 in 10 Republicans said they are less likely to vote for Trump after the verdict. But fair warning: Those voters are in the clear minority of their party.\n\nIn fact, in the same poll, 55% of Republican voters said the verdict didn\u2019t make a difference to their votes, and 34% said it made them more likely to vote for Trump.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the 1 in 10 GOP voters who said they were less likely to vote for Trump were nearly identical to what an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found before the verdict. That survey, conducted May 21-23, showed that 10% of Republicans said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he was convicted, 25% said they would be more likely, and 68% said it would make no difference.\n\nMake no mistake: Even a sliver of Republicans defecting from Trump could be decisive five months from now. But the major takeaway \u2014 right now \u2014 is how 9 in 10 Republicans are standing behind him in the Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nThe overall political environment hasn\u2019t changed much: That might be the biggest conclusion so far from the early post-conviction polls. Two of the polls \u2014 Reuters/Ipsos and Morning Consult \u2014 released the results of the race between Biden and Trump after the verdict. While the movement in each was in Biden\u2019s direction, it was within the margin of error and looked like other national surveys we\u2019ve seen before the verdict.\n\nReuters/Ipsos poll of registered voters: Biden 41%, Trump 39% (compared to Biden 40%, Trump 40% previously).\n\nMorning Consult poll of registered voters: Biden 45%, Trump 44% (compared to Trump 44%, Biden 42% previously).\n\nIn addition, the ABC News/Ipsos poll found the favorability ratings for Trump and Biden to be essentially unchanged from a survey in March.\n\nA permanent 2- or 3-point shift to Biden could also be decisive come November. Still, national polls showing 41%-vs.-39% or 44%-vs.-42% results don\u2019t tell us who\u2019s going to win \u2014 they only suggest that the race is close (especially under the Electoral College system). Plus, Trump\u2019s guilty verdict is unlikely to be the last major twist in the presidential election.\n\nRead more takeaways from the post-Trump verdict polls \u2192\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Today\u2019s top stories \u2696\ufe0f Another week, another trial: Hunter Biden\u2019s trial in Delaware kicked off with jury selection Monday, as the president\u2019s son faces three firearms-related charges.

      "news": "Amy Walter, The Cook Political Report:\n\nYes.\n\nSo I'm with Tam that the polls aren't really telling us all that much right now, in part because they were taken immediately afterward. And I think that folks still hadn't really processed that yet, but also because the election isn't in May. It's in November.\n\nAnd I think if you look at who the undecided voters are in this election, many of them are people who dislike both of these candidates equally. And they are going to make their choice about whether to vote at all or which candidate to vote for probably as we get into September and October.\n\nAnd where the focus, where the spotlight is in September and October is going to matter a lot more. We also have some other cases that have yet to be delivered. Obviously, the Supreme Court's decision on whether President Trump can claim presidential immunity, I think that has \u2014 that could have an impact as well.\n\nThat's any day now we could see that case coming down. Fundamentally, though, what Democrats do believe is that the focus less on maybe the case and the convicted felon piece, more on this idea that Trump is going to come back looking for a retribution, looking to foment violence, connecting it to a lot of the things that were helpful to Democrats in 2022, especially when they talked about January 6 and people who election deniers or who said that, if the elections don't go the way we want, we're going to overturn them.",

      "news": "BUFFALO, N.Y. \u2014 Legislation that proponents have named the \u201cFair College Admissions Act\u201d is meant to prohibit New York state two- and four-year schools from considering family alumni when choosing new students.\n\nAssembly sponsor Latrice Walker, D-Brooklyn, said the practice effectively discriminates against low-income families and students of color.\n\n\"The Fair College Admissions Act is about leveling the playing field,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe know that education is the civil rights issue of our time and that with an access to a quality education, even through college, basically breaks down generational curses.\u201d\n\nTully Rinckey Associate Attorney Nick Marricco said the legislation is well-intentioned.\n\n\"Nobody wants someone to get into a college, let alone a good college, simply because their grandparents went there or simply because their wife went there or their husband went there, their parents went there, their older sibling went there,\u201d Marricco said. \u201cNobody wants that.\u201d\n\nHowever, Marricco believes some of the language raises questions and concerns. He said the bill would prohibit colleges from asking where family members went to school and bars the information from being among the documents they include in admissions considerations.\n\n\"The college could still consider it,\" Marricco said. \"There's nothing preventing them from doing that. All it does is it prevents the college from asking where your family members went to school.\"\n\nThe attorney said it raises questions about what colleges should do if legacy information is offered voluntarily in personal statements, essays and interviews. He also believes it could be ripe for a lawsuit, specifically from religious schools who could claim the prohibition is a violation of the First Amendment.\n\n\"They might come out and say, \u2018listen, our religious values say we have to consider this.\u2019 That could be a challenge. It might be a successful one,\" Marricco said.\n\nWalker said the bottom line is everybody should have equal access to education, regardless of the family from which they're born. She said she hopes to pass the bill this year.\n\n\"I am pushing very hard, together with my colleague in the Senate, and there are a number of other advocates who are hoping that we are actually going to be able to get this done as well,\" Walker said.\n\nThe legislation does not apply to postgraduate degree programs. Marricco also pointed out the proposed legislation does not create an opportunity for individuals to sue institutions.\n\nRather, it would institute a penalty equal to 10% of a school's prior year full-time equivalent first-year students multiplied by its tuition and fees. The money would then be used to help subsidize school for students from lower income families.",

      "title": "As a congressman defended Trump, his 6-year-old son stole the spotlight",
      "news": "When Rep. John Rose (R-Tenn.) approached the lectern on the House floor, he said he was going to \u201caddress the terrible precedent\u201d set by former president Donald Trump\u2019s criminal conviction. But only a few seconds into his speech, he no longer had everyone\u2019s attention. Rose\u2019s 6-year-old son, Guy, smiled and leaned closer into C-SPAN\u2019s camera shot while sitting behind his dad. As Rose called Trump the victim of a \u201cpolitically driven\u201d conviction, Guy stuck out his tongue with wide eyes and shook his head \u2014 a clip that has turned into a meme.\n\nGuy \u2014 who told The Washington Post on Tuesday that his dad\u2019s nearly five-minute speech was \u201cso boring\u201d \u2014 continued to make gestures with his face and hands. A video of Rose\u2019s address \u2014 and Guy\u2019s antics \u2014 has been viewed more than 3.8 million times on social media and was a highlight of the day\u2019s floor discussions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRose said he told Guy before his speech to smile at the camera for his 3-year-old brother, Sam, who was watching from Tennessee. After introducing viewers to his tongue about 30 seconds into his dad\u2019s speech, Guy tilted his head to the right and smiled before shaping his hands into the letters \u201cS,\u201d \u201cA\u201d and \u201cM.\u201d Meanwhile, Rose called for \u201cjustice\u201d for Trump, who was convicted on 34 felony counts Thursday.\n\n\u201cMay 30th will be among the more infamous dates in American history,\u201d Rose said about one minute and 20 seconds into his speech, unaware that Monday would also be a notable day for his son\u2019s internet fame.\n\nGuy scooted away from the center of C-SPAN\u2019s camera shot, making only half his body visible. However, he continued to put on a show, shaking and squeezing a rubber cat toy named KitKat, Rose\u2019s communications director, Dylan Jones, told The Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Rose claimed that \u201cTrump\u2019s prosecution was driven by nefarious politics rather than the law\u201d roughly two minutes into his address, Guy waved to the camera and smiled.\n\nAbout a minute later, Rose said there should be \u201cimmunity for this type of prosecution.\u201d Around the same time, Guy appeared to shape his hands into a heart.\n\nWhen Rose returned to his office about an hour after his address, Jones, showed him the video.\n\n\u201cLike any dad, [I was] like, \u2018Oh, no,\u2019\u201d Rose told The Post. But he said he found Guy\u2019s stunts funny and heartwarming.\n\nGuy graduated from kindergarten last week and is visiting his dad in D.C. for a week. Rose, 59, said he brings his two sons to many events, but they don\u2019t typically appear on camera.\n\n\u201cGenerally, Guy is pretty good,\u201d Rose said. \u201cHe behaves pretty well. But he\u2019s like any 6-year-old boy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRose said that his colleagues have high-fived Guy since watching the video. On X, Doug Andres, the press secretary for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), wrote \u201cKid is a generational talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cRep. Rose\u2019s son is more mature than many regulars on the House floor,\u201d Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) wrote.\n\nRose was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2018. Two years later, he supported a lawsuit that contested the results of the 2020 presidential election. In 2021, he voted against awarding Congressional Gold Medals to police who protected the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack. He also opposed creating an independent commission to investigate the riot.\n\nGuy wasn\u2019t the first child to attract attention at political events.\n\nPrince Louis, the youngest child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, closed his eyes, placed his hands over his ears and appeared to scream during a military flyover at Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s Platinum Jubilee in June 2022. During Rudy Giuliani\u2019s inaugural address as New York City\u2019s mayor in 1994, his son, Andrew, mimicked Rudy by raising his right hand, shaking the judge\u2019s hand and thanking the crowd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones said he often sees children sitting behind their parents during House speeches. Typically, he said, the kids talk quietly. But he believed Guy\u2019s facial expressions would circulate on social media because they \u201cwere just so dramatic.\u201d\n\nHe said he gave Guy some \u201cmedia training\u201d to prepare for the multiple interview requests he had received.",

      "title": "Fauci draws GOP ire but Kennedy may be making him a problem for Trump",
      "news": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe public lashing Dr. Anthony Fauci faced on Capitol Hill Monday was illustrative of his enduring unpopularity with the GOP\u2019s conservative base. Yet even as Republicans seek to capitalize on that dislike of the infectious disease expert, former President Donald Trump\u2019s past elevation of Fauci is a potential vulnerability as he fights off an insurgent independent campaign from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nIncreasingly, Kennedy\u2019s third-party White House bid is gaining traction by attacking Trump\u2019s Covid-19 policies. He has, for example, accused Trump of \u201cinventing lockdowns\u201d and has questioned the safety of the Covid vaccine his administration helped develop.\n\nKennedy has also jabbed Trump over his reliance on Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. He recently launched a line of merchandise tying Trump and Fauci together.\n\n\u201cVote for Trump/Fauci 2024,\u201d the new campaign shirts say, along with a tongue-in-cheek slogan: \u201cGive us another shot!\u201d\n\nTrump has attempted to downplay Fauci\u2019s role in his administration. In an interview last month with Tim Pool, a podcaster favored by the far right, Trump claimed Fauci \u201cwasn\u2019t a big player in my administration like he was after I left when Biden made him the king of everything.\u201d\n\nAt Monday\u2019s House subcommittee hearing about the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Republicans didn\u2019t mention Trump in their grilling of Fauci \u2014 his first public testimony on the Hill since retiring. But Trump\u2019s party increasingly has made Fauci an avatar of the retribution they are seeking if the Republican returns to office. At the macro-level, his supporters have proposed ideas that would make it easier to fire federal workers, like Fauci. Trump has repeatedly suggested he couldn\u2019t fire Fauci during his term because of laws that protect career civil servants.\n\nAt one point during Monday\u2019s hearing, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia asserted that Fauci \u201cbelongs in prison\u201d over his time leading the country\u2019s pandemic response, a sentiment that has been echoed by other members of Congress and online by other Trump supporters.\n\nAfter the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, thanked Fauci for his years of service Monday, Laura Loomer, a conservative provocateur who operates on the edges of Trump\u2019s political operation, posted on social media: \u201cDr. Fauci is a criminal and needs to be treated like one. Not be thanked by the REPUBLICAN CHAIR of the Select subcommittee on coronavirus.\u201d\n\nKennedy has given quarter to these views. In a recent interview, when conservative commentator Glenn Beck asked him, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t (Fauci) in jail?\u201d Kennedy responded, \u201cHe\u2019s not in jail because Joe Biden is president.\u201d\n\nKennedy isn\u2019t the first to use Fauci in an attempt to drive a wedge between Trump and his base. During the GOP primary, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis regularly invoked the longtime public health expert to attack Trump from the right, noting the former president gave Fauci a commendation on his last day in office.\n\nTrumped claimed he didn\u2019t know who gave Fauci the commendation, leading DeSantis to joke: \u201cIs this the immaculate commendation or something like that? Did this just happen out of thin air?\u201d\n\nBut DeSantis\u2019 efforts ultimately failed to make a dent in Trump\u2019s support with the GOP base. While Kennedy faces an uphill climb to get on the ballot in every state, polling suggests he has nevertheless become a problem for Trump as he centers his campaign around vaccines and the coronavirus response.\n\nOne recent poll from Monmouth University showed support for Kennedy among Republicans grew slightly once they learned of his views on vaccines and Covid. It\u2019s just one datapoint, though it explains the urgency of Trump\u2019s recent attacks on Kennedy.\n\nDavid Robertson, a 50-year-old San Antonio real estate developer, voted for Trump in 2020, but told CNN he switched to Kennedy after hearing the independent candidate talk about Covid on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast.\n\n\u201cI just felt like we were misled, you know, and a lot of ways and a lot of stuff that we were told that wasn\u2019t true, we\u2019ve now found out that it is true,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cTowards the end with Covid, the way he handled it, with the lockdowns and everything else, I felt like he just kind of bowed down to what he was told to do.\u201d\n\nIn the face of this rising threat, Trump has lately stepped up his attacks on Kennedy, labeling him an \u201cextreme liberal\u201d and \u201cfake anti-vaxxer\u201d in a video posted to social media last month. Kennedy is a leading purveyor of anti-vaccine misinformation and has long espoused unfounded views of inoculations that doctors and medical authorities have easily debunked.\n\n\u201cRFK\u2019s views on vaccines are fake, as is everything else about his candidacy,\u201d the former president said in the video.\n\nTrump has long had a fraught relationship with the Covid vaccine, one of the most consequential achievements of his four years in office. As it became less popular among Republicans, Trump stopped mentioning the vaccine. Amid DeSantis\u2019 criticism and Kennedy\u2019s rise, he started telling crowds he would not give \u201cone penny\u201d to a school that requires students to get a Covid vaccine or wear a mask.\n\nIn a recent interview with Time, Trump both touted the development of the Covid vaccine through Operation Warp Speed while also declining to say if he would push vaccines so aggressively if given the chance again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been given a lot of credit for Operation Warp Speed. But most of that credit has come from Democrats,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I think a big portion of Republicans agree with it, too. But a lot of them don\u2019t want to say it. They don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d",

      "title": "Lawmakers expensed millions in 2023 under new program that doesn\u2019t require receipts",
      "news": "More than 300 House lawmakers were reimbursed at least $5.2 million for food and lodging while on official business in Washington last year under a new, taxpayer-funded program that does not require them to provide receipts. The program, which kicked off last year after a House panel passed it with bipartisan support, was intended to make it easier for lawmakers to cover the cost of maintaining separate homes in D.C. and their home districts. But critics argue that its reliance on the honor system and lack of transparent record-keeping makes it ripe for abuse.\n\nThe reimbursement scheme\u2019s lack of receipt requirements is a \u201cridiculous loophole,\u201d said Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the good government group Public Citizen. \u201cClearly it becomes very difficult to tell whether or not it\u2019s a legitimate payment and whether it\u2019s proper,\u201d Holman added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program has only a few strict rules: Lawmakers cannot be repaid for principal or interest on their mortgages, they can only get reimbursement for days they\u2019re actually working or flying to D.C., and they can\u2019t ask for more back than their actual expenses. They\u2019re also subject to daily spending caps determined by the General Services Administration. Members are \u201cstrongly encouraged,\u201d but not required, to keep records of their expenses, according to guidance issued by the House Committee on Administration.\n\nThe same rules apply to every member. But lawmakers\u2019 reimbursements requests have varied widely, and because the program doesn\u2019t require receipts or detailed public disclosure of what members are expensing, taxpayers have to take lawmakers\u2019 word that they\u2019re playing by the rules.\n\nOf the 435 voting members of the House, 319 members \u2014 153 Democrats and 166 Republicans \u2014 received reimbursement for some food or lodging expenses last year, alongside three delegates from U.S. territories. The other 116 members received no money from the reimbursement program, according to a Washington Post review of the first 11 months of data released by the House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), the program\u2019s overall top spender, was reimbursed for nearly $30,000 in lodging expenses and more than $10,000 for food in 2023. He was reimbursed for more than $4,000 for lodging in two different months and more than $3,000 in five different months.\n\nA spokesperson for Gaetz said he was reimbursed for lodging expenses on days when the House was out of session but Gaetz remained in Washington on official business for depositions related to his post on the select committee on weaponization of the federal government.\n\n\u201cRep. Gaetz has always complied with House rules regarding congressional reimbursements,\u201d a spokesperson for Gaetz emailed in a statement. \u201cIn 2023, Rep. Gaetz dedicated significant time to his work on the Weaponization Subcommittee, requiring his presence to be in Washington, D.C., on days often when there were no votes, which incurred additional reimbursement expenses to conduct depositions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther members of the weaponization committee expensed significantly less than Gaetz.\n\nSome members of Congress who own homes in the Washington area, including Reps. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Mike McCaul (R-Tex.), have chosen not to participate in the program at all. Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), who owns a $1 million home in Virginia, was reimbursed less than $1,500 each month.\n\nBut other D.C. area homeowners, including Reps. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) and Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), requested significantly higher reimbursements than Banks did for some months of 2023.\n\nMace, who co-owns a $1,649,000 Capitol Hill townhouse she purchased in 2021 with her then-fianc\u00e9, Patrick Bryant, expensed a total of $19,395 over the nine-month period ending on Sept. 30, 2023, an average of more than $2,000 a month. She expensed over $3,000 for lodging in January, March and May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwalwell, who purchased a $1,215,000 home in the Eckington neighborhood of Washington, was reimbursed nearly $19,000 for lodging expenses over 11 months in 2023. In May of that year, he received $2,838 in lodging reimbursement.\n\nAs homeowners, Mace and Swalwell aren\u2019t allowed to ask taxpayers to cover their mortgage payments, and can only expense taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities and other ancillary costs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing \u2018average\u2019 about having three children and a wife who are trying to live between two expensive areas,\u201d Swalwell spokeswoman Cassie Baloue said in a statement. \u201cThe Congressman\u2019s expenses reflect the actual cost of working in D.C. and are signed off by House Administration.\u201d\n\nSwalwell owed about $1,144 per month in taxes and insurance alone, according to figures provided by his spokeswoman, and incurred other home maintenance costs she declined to specify.\n\n\u201cEvery month is different as to what maintenance costs Rep. Swalwell is reimbursed for,\u201d she added. \u201cEverything he does is allowable.\u201d\n\nMace was told by people involved with her office finances that she could not justify claiming more than about $1,800 a month for expenses on the townhouse, according to two people familiar with the discussions, who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private conversations. One source showed The Post a document laying out Mace\u2019s monthly expenses for the townhouse and calculating them as $1,726.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMace instructed her staff to seek the maximum reimbursement each day the House was in session, regardless of her actual expenses, two former members of her staff and one other person familiar with the matter alleged to The Post. Mace denies that allegation.\n\nMace denied wrongdoing and declined to explain her expenses in detail. Her office did not answer questions about maintenance and other costs related to the house she co-owns with her ex-fianc\u00e9. Mace owns 28 percent of the home, according to the deed, but did not answer questions about what percentage of the bills she paid. She did not claim any expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023, but did not explain why.\n\n\u201cWe follow all the rules for reimbursements,\u201d said Gabrielle Lipsky, a spokeswoman for Mace, who said the office found $300,000 in other savings last year unrelated to the reimbursement program.\n\nMace has been at war with a group of her former staffers for months. Her former chief of staff, Daniel Hanlon, took steps this year to run against her in a primary. He later bowed out. Mace\u2019s main opponent in a hotly contested June 11 primary is Catherine Templeton, a former South Carolina gubernatorial candidate who has accused Mace of flip-flopping \u201cfor fame.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMisusing taxpayer funds under the members\u2019 allowance could violate both House rules and federal law, said Kedric Payne, former deputy chief counsel of the Office of Congressional Ethics, who now serves as the vice president of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan government watchdog group. Payne said that anyone who misuses the program could face corruption charges similar to those brought against Aaron Schock, a former congressman from Illinois who used government and campaign funds to remodel his Capitol Hill office in the style of the TV show \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new travel reimbursement rules cover very specific expenses and have strict dollar limits,\u201d said Payne. \u201cAny member who violates these rules and submits false reimbursement claims can face civil and criminal penalties. The Office of Congressional Ethics frequently investigates members\u2019 blatant misuse of taxpayer dollars. Voters have a right to know that their elected officials aren\u2019t using public funds for personal expenses.\u201d\n\nThe member reimbursement program has been popular, but any perception of unfair enrichment could endanger it. Congress is already one of the least trusted government institutions, and 81 percent of Americans believe that members of Congress do a somewhat or very bad job at keeping their personal financial interests separate from their work in Congress, according to a September 2023 Pew Research poll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bipartisan House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress suggested the member reimbursement account program in 2022 as an alternative to raising members\u2019 salaries. Defenders of the program have argued that it matches benefits offered to lawmakers\u2019 counterparts in the private sector and executive branch and encourages diversity of representation.\n\nMembers of Congress make $174,000 per year, which is about twice the median U.S. household income, but they must usually maintain two households: one in Washington, an expensive metro area, and another in their home districts. Many commute long distances at great expense.\n\nSome good-government and anti-corruption groups argue that higher lawmaker salaries would make public service more attractive to a wider array of Americans and discourage corruption. But members of Congress have not given themselves a raise since 2009, as voting to do so is considered politically unpalatable. Some lawmakers have turned to living in their own offices to defray the costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI wish members would give themselves a raise that they probably deserve and then we\u2019d all move on,\u201d said a staffer involved with congressional accounting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the program publicly. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have the backbone to do that, so [they gave] members a raise through this backdoor way that allows for abuse because there is no record keeping and there\u2019s no receipts.\u201d",

      "title": "A complication to Republicans\u2019 allegation the justice system favors Democrats",
      "news": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nLast week, President Joe Biden was defending the justice system as a \u201ccornerstone\u201d of society.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don\u2019t like the verdict,\u201d Biden said at the White House after Republicans tried to undercut the process that led to former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction in New York on state charges.\n\nThis week, the president will have to remember those words while his son Hunter faces federal gun charges at a trial in Delaware, the first of two separate cases this year that could lead to jail time.\n\nThe Biden family must be frustrated that a plea deal fell apart last year when it was rejected by the Trump-appointed judge in the case, Maryellen Noreika. Plus, these particular gun charges are rarely prosecuted on their own, perhaps evidence of the enhanced scrutiny placed on a president\u2019s son.\n\nVery different trials\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s gun trial is very different than Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial, even if they both come in an election year, feature the public airing of painful, personal details and essentially boil down to allegations of lying on paperwork.\n\nTrump had to endure the detailed, public testimony of Stormy Daniels, the adult-film actress who alleged an affair with Trump nearly 20 years ago.\n\nHunter Biden will have to endure a public recounting of his affair with his brother Beau\u2019s widow, their tortured text messages and his drug addiction.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s legal problems all revolve around his own campaigns and actions during and after his presidency. Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments meant to cover up the alleged affair from voters in 2016. He also faces federal charges of mishandling classified information in Florida and trying to overturn the 2020 election in Washington, DC, as well as Georgia.\n\nHunter Biden faces trial in Delaware starting this week for lying on a firearm background check application. He checked the box that said \u201cno\u201d he was not abusing or addicted to drugs. He also faces trial in California later this year for tax evasion. David Weiss, the Trump-appointed special counsel prosecuting the case, has never made allegations to tie Hunter Biden\u2019s tax problems to his father, although Republicans on Capitol Hill have tried, unsuccessfully, to connect the dots.\n\nI\u2019ve written before about how the Department of Justice ends up prosecuting similar numbers of Democratic and Republican lawmakers. In New York this week, for instance, the bribery trial of New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez \u2013 his second distinct corruption trial in recent years \u2013 is underway.\n\nTrump may ultimately avoid federal prosecution. There is a very real possibility that Trump, while found guilty in a New York courtroom, will face neither set of the federal charges brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith before Election Day in November.\n\nThe US Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity, and the judge in his classified documents case has delayed proceedings indefinitely. The Georgia case is also delayed, and an appeals court may not consider whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis can stay on the case until October.\n\nA chorus of bias allegations\n\nBut while Joe Biden\u2019s son and the senior senator from New Jersey are both in major legal peril, it is quickly becoming an article of faith among Republicans that they are a targeted species by the justice system.\n\n\u201cWhat people are seeing now is that they can\u2019t trust our judicial system,\u201d Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nThe justice system \u201chunts Republicans while protecting Democrats,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, reacting to the Trump guilty verdict.\n\nIn a fundraising pitch on X, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida encouraged supporters angry about the \u201ctravesty\u201d to \u201cget even.\u201d\n\nAppearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas took the conspiracy theorizing much further, arguing that the Department of Justice is only prosecuting Menendez and, separately, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas (who is also charged with bribery) because they have been critical of Biden on foreign relations and immigration policy \u2013 an allegation for which there is no evidence.\n\nCotton predicted Biden would ultimately pardon his son. The White House has said there will be no pardon for Hunter Biden.\n\nEven Republicans who opposed Trump during the 2024 primary season are critical of Trump\u2019s New York conviction.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu complained that Trump will face sentencing days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. \u201cThat is a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to do nothing but rile everybody up. It\u2019s going to look even more political than it is now, and just cast a shadow of a doubt on this entire case.\u201d\n\n\u2018I may feel differently about it\u2019\n\nThe irony here is that Trump in 2020 actually did pressure the Department of Justice to investigate Hunter Biden. He also pushed Ukraine\u2019s government to open an investigation, hoping to tie Hunter Biden\u2019s work for a Ukrainian natural gas company to his father.\n\nIn 2016, Trump\u2019s supporters would launch into \u201clock her up\u201d chants targeting Hillary Clinton \u2013 behavior Trump encouraged at the time even though the FBI, in the form of then-director James Comey, announced before the election that there was not a strong enough case to prosecute Clinton over her private email server. Trump said on Fox News over the weekend that if elected again, he might feel differently about pushing for charges against Clinton.\n\n\u201cThey all said \u2018lock her up.\u2019 But I felt \u2013 and I could have done it \u2013 but I thought it would have been a terrible thing. And then this happened to me. So I may feel differently about it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nDemocrats promise to let the process play out against Hunter Biden\n\nDon\u2019t expect Democrats to show the same level of support for Hunter Biden that Republicans have shown for Trump.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, promised Democrats would respect the process as it plays out against the president\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are not out there saying that Hunter Biden\u2019s trial is a farce, it\u2019s a fraud, it\u2019s rigged. We\u2019re not attacking the justice system,\u201d he said.",

      "title": "Hunter Biden trial on federal gun charges: What to know",
      "news": "CNN \u2014\n\nHunter Biden is set to stand trial Monday on felony gun charges in a historic case that could impact President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nThis is the first time in American history that the child of the sitting president is going on trial. The indictment was brought by the Justice Department, specifically by David Weiss, the special counsel appointed last year to oversee the Hunter Biden probes.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about his struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nThe trial could last one to two weeks and is taking place in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWhat are the charges?\n\nThe first two charges in the three-count indictment are tied to the gun purchase itself.\n\nWhen a person buys a gun, they must fill out a form with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and affirm that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been charged with lying on those forms.\n\nThese questions include: Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a fugitive? Are you in the country unlawfully? And, importantly for this case, are you an \u201cunlawful user of, or addicted to\u201d illegal drugs? Hunter Biden allegedly checked the box that said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nCount 3 relates to the possession of the gun. It\u2019s also against federal law to possess a gun if you are abusing drugs. Hunter Biden had the gun for 11 days in October 2018, before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster because she was worried about his mental health, according to the indictment and texts made public in recent court filings.\n\n\u201cGuns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that\u2019s the impetus behind these laws,\u201d Nabeel Kibria, a Washington, DC-based defense attorney who has handled hundreds of gun cases, told CNN. \u201cThe evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter \u2026 but who determines who is an addict? What are the bright-line rules that must be followed?\u201d\n\nWho are the witnesses?\n\nProsecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case.\n\nMost notably, they\u2019ve lined up testimony from three of Hunter Biden\u2019s former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle and his late brother\u2019s widow, Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated.\n\nTheir testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to experience stress and shame at the trial,\u201d said Valerie Earnshaw, a social psychology professor at the University of Delaware who researches the stigmas surrounding addiction. \u201cIt depends on his own recovery journey, but there could be days where he experiences a lot of shame. It\u2019s a toxic emotion that eats you up. It does not motivate healthy behaviors.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wanted to call an expert who could tell the jury about how people with addictions understand their own struggles. But in a ruling Sunday, the judge blocked the defense attorneys from using that witness because of procedural defects with their disclosures to prosecutors about what the expert might say.\n\nHis team also has a forensic chemist who could testify about a white residue on his gun pouch that prosecutors say testified positive for cocaine when it was analyzed by the FBI in 2023.\n\nWho are the prosecutors?\n\nThe case was initiated by Weiss, the former Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware. Attorney General Merrick Garland elevated Weiss to special counsel status last year, after a proposed plea deal with Hunter Biden blew up in spectacular fashion.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s lawyers claimed Weiss only sought the indictment because he caved to a relentless pressure campaign from Republican lawmakers and the former president. Weiss panned this theory as a \u201cfiction designed for a Hollywood script,\u201d and the judge overseeing the gun case concluded the allegations were \u201cnonsensical under the facts here.\u201d\n\nBut many Republicans have criticized Weiss, claiming he offered Hunter Biden a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d last year that would have resolved the gun matter and ended a tax probe with a misdemeanor-only plea. (Legal experts told CNN at the time that the proposed deal was reasonable.)\n\nWho is the judge?\n\nDistrict Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case. A former patent lawyer, she had the support of Delaware\u2019s two Democratic senators when she was appointed by Trump. The Senate confirmed her nomination with a unanimous voice vote in 2018.\n\nShe oversaw last summer\u2019s dramatic hearing during which both sides asked her to approve a plea deal. But she balked and uncovered through tough questioning that there were grave differences between the parties about the scope of the deal. That hearing ended without a resolution, and the plea discussions later collapsed. That\u2019s when Garland named Weiss as special counsel.\n\nNoreika\u2019s no-nonsense approach has kept the proceedings moving in a steady fashion. She rejected Hunter Biden\u2019s attempts to toss the case or derail the prosecution but has sided with him on several key evidentiary questions.\n\nCould Hunter Biden go to prison?\n\nIf convicted on all three counts, the president\u2019s son could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\nHowever, he doesn\u2019t have a prior criminal record, and first-time offenders often get much lower sentences than the maximum. His punishment would be solely up to Noreika.\n\nThese are federal charges, so Joe Biden has the power to pardon his son at any time. If his son is convicted, the president could also commute the sentence, sparing him from the levied punishment.\n\nThe White House has explicitly ruled out the possibility of a pardon, but that political calculus could change after the November election.\n\nHas this ever happened before?\n\nThis is a historic moment for the United States and the history of the presidency. No president has ever tried to run the country while watching his own child go on trial.\n\nOver the decades, there are plenty of examples of presidential family members getting in trouble. George H. W. Bush\u2019s son faced civil penalties for violating banking laws while his father was serving in the White House. Jimmy Carter\u2019s brother was scrutinized for his foreign lobbying. But nothing has sunk to the level of a criminal trial.\n\nCNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said that \u201cthere\u2019s always somebody considered a black sheep in the presidential family\u201d but that Hunter Biden\u2019s sprawling legal issues \u201ccut unusually close to the bone because it\u2019s the president\u2019s son.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis trial is an albatross around President Biden\u2019s neck and weighs very heavily on his psyche,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cFor any parent to watch their child go through addiction, and now face possible jail time, it\u2019s harrowing. You would hope that family would be his comfort zone. But in this case, family is probably his biggest worry of the moment.\u201d\n\nThe family ties have also led to some intriguing divergences between father and son.\n\nThere is a separate court battle over the constitutionality of the law that makes it illegal for drug users to own a gun. The Biden administration is defending the law and wants the Supreme Court to take up the matter. But Hunter Biden\u2019s team argued in his case \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 that the law violates the Second Amendment.\n\nThe jury pool\n\nApproximately 250 Delaware residents have been summoned for jury service, according to the judge. They\u2019ll be whittled down to a panel of 12 seated jurors and four alternates.\n\nDelaware is one of the smallest states in the country, and the Biden family looms large.\n\nAs part of the selection process \u2013 called voir dire \u2013 prospective jurors will be asked whether they can stay impartial regardless of their views about the 2024 election. They\u2019ll also be asked whether they can keep an open mind about Hunter Biden and even whether they\u2019ve been eligible to vote in past elections for Joe Biden, who has held public office in Delaware since 1971.\n\nOther questions touch on the highly politicized atmosphere surrounding the case, including, \u201cDo you believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States?\u201d or, coming from the other side, whether they think he \u201cis not being prosecuted for other crimes because his father is the President.\u201d\n\nWhat has Hunter Biden said?\n\nSince his indictments last year, Hunter Biden hasn\u2019t said much about his legal cases.\n\nHe spoke out in December amid his fight with the House Republicans who are probing his business dealings and took responsibility for having \u201cmade mistakes in my life and wasted opportunities and privileges that I was afforded.\u201d But he slammed the \u201cMAGA right\u201d lawmakers who \u201cridiculed my struggle with addiction\u201d and \u201cbelittled my recovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have tried to dehumanize me, all to embarrass and damage my father,\u201d he said.\n\nPreviously, Hunter Biden shared intensely personal details about his addiction in his 2021 memoir, which prosecutors plan to use against him at trial. He described his stints in rehab, his relapses, how he bought drugs near the White House, and the stretches of time when he \u201chad no plan beyond the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\u201d\n\nThe laptop, texts and emails\n\nOne of the most notable pieces of evidence in the case will be messages from Hunter Biden\u2019s infamous laptop, which has been at the center of a yearslong political saga. Weiss said the material \u201cis real\u201d and will be an important part of his case, rebutting past claims from the president\u2019s son that the laptop might be fake or even Russian disinformation.\n\nRepublican officials and right-wing outlets have seized on the laptop\u2019s embarrassing emails and sexually explicit images to attack Hunter Biden, while his lawyers say the files were manipulated and sued a repair-shop owner who helped make the materials public.\n\nMany on the right celebrated this move by Weiss, even if he hasn\u2019t verified their loftier anti-Biden allegations. The New York Post, the conservative tabloid that was first to publish messages from the laptop in 2020, recently took a victory lap on its front cover.\n\nIn a ruling last month, Noreika said she\u2019ll let Hunter Biden challenge the authenticity of any messages introduced at trial. Some of the texts contain gut-wrenching arguments between Hunter Biden and his loved ones about his sobriety. Others show him meeting up with drug dealers, including some just a few blocks from the Wilmington federal courthouse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I\u2019m delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I\u2019ve ruined every relationship I\u2019ve ever cherished,\u201d he texted Hallie Biden in November 2018, according to Weiss\u2019 filings.\n\nProsecutors plan to use the laptop to specifically support their claim that he was using illegal drugs when he bought the gun in 2018. Weiss has not addressed \u2013 and the case is not about \u2013 Republicans\u2019 unproven allegation that emails from the laptop prove that Hunter Biden and his father were involved in corrupt foreign business deals.\n\nWhat about the tax charges?\n\nThis is just one of two trials Hunter Biden faces this year.\n\nThe second case is scheduled for September in Los Angeles and revolves around Hunter Biden\u2019s troubled finances. He has pleaded not guilty to tax evasion, filing false tax returns and failing to file his taxes on time.\n\nOriginally, the trials were both scheduled for June, but Hunter Biden got a reprieve from the California federal judge, who agreed to postpone that trial. But the September trial date means that case will coincide with the final stretch of the presidential campaign.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified a potential prosecution witness. It has also been updated to correct when Hunter Biden sent Hallie Biden a 2018 text.\n\nCNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Transcript: Vivek Ramaswamy on BuzzFeed, politics and media",
      "news": "Nayeema Raza: So first question: Explain what you\u2019re trying to do with BuzzFeed. Is this a play to achieve what Elon did with Twitter, but with lower stakes and a lower price tag, or something else?\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Well, look, I laid it out pretty clearly in the letter I sent to the board, I enjoy creating value. That is something that I\u2019ve done in my career as an entrepreneur, I\u2019ve always had an instinct as a value investor as well, and I see a lot of value destroyed by the way this business has been run. I\u2019m not in the phase of casting blame or pointing fingers at one individual versus another.\n\nBut the fact is, this was a potentially very valuable business at the time it went public. Certainly a lot of people with a lot of money backed it on that premise. And it has cratered on the back of a lot of business failures that I believe are still correctable. There\u2019s a lot of different businesses and a lot of different industries that could fit that description, but my particular interest in the media did come from my interface with the media over the last year and a half, that taught me a lot of things about how the media landscape works.\n\nAD\n\nAnd so for me, it\u2019s a combination of a mission orientation to create the kind of media company that I think the public deserves, but to do it in a way that creates what I view as potentially massive shareholder value. It\u2019s a lot of fun, it\u2019s also productive. But I think that\u2019s going to require massive, drastic, strategic change to a business that is patently in trouble. I think that this is a business that has admitted some of its failures from a business perspective, but they\u2019re really just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, when I think a complete overhaul is required. And when I saw nobody else stepping up to the plate to do it, I saw an opportunity. And I believe in driving change through the private sector for the better, creating value in the process, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do here.\n\nBen Smith: Well, as somebody who cares a lot about BuzzFeed, although all that abstract stuff sounds great for me. I should say, I was also there probably for the single worst business decision we made, which was not selling to Disney for $500 million back in 2014, so I will not lecture you on value creation. But a lot of people do think that this venture is a bit like your campaign in that it\u2019s a lot of money, a lot of attention, but ultimately, there\u2019s no way for you to get the votes. Jonah Peretti votes: 64% of the stock. How\u2019s that gonna work?\n\nVivek: There\u2019s so many circular references that I\u2019ve had even in the 48 hours since my stake was initially reported, and since my letter went in to the board \u2014 the media\u2019s reporting of it \u2014 that actually almost proved my thesis for how broken and in some cases idiotic, downright low-IQ, the media really is in situations like this.\n\nAD\n\nBen: Wow, thank you. Was it that good a question? I think that was a pretty straightforward question, Vivek. This is a company with two classes of stock.\n\nVivek: And I\u2019ll give you a straightforward answer. It was preamble to an obvious point, that I\u2019m just disappointed that people in media can\u2019t take notice of, because there\u2019s a gap in business understanding. So ordinarily, if you have super-voting shares, yes, absolutely, you\u2019re the person who decides the governance of the company.\n\nThere\u2019s a curious fact about this company that the entire reporting of that line of thinking completely missed, which is \u2014 I would add to a list of journalistic failures that grows every day \u2014 this is a company that has more debt than cash. That debt comes due this December. So anybody who thinks that Jonah Peretti is the person in control of this business because some piece of paper says he has voting rights over the shares is delusional, to borrow a word from the subtitle of your own book describing the same industry, Ben. It\u2019s delusion.\n\nAD\n\nI\u2019ll leave it at this for now: The game theory of a traditional situation, where you have founder-controlled shares versus an outside shareholder, changes completely when you have debt that comes due that\u2019s deeply underwater from its conversion price, and that comes due at a moment where the company has less cash than debt [and] is losing money on a growing basis. I\u2019ll leave it at that for now. But I think somebody who has basic intuitions of how those situations play out would maybe rethink the idea that Jonah actually has full control of this company.\n\nBen: Just playing that out, there\u2019s sort of an obvious logic to taking the company private in that situation. And I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s the direction you\u2019d want to take it.\n\nVivek: Look, I think there\u2019s a menu of options available. Frankly, I haven\u2019t had my first meeting with the company yet. I\u2019m always a big believer in any issue, business issues included, to make sure you get the best arguments for the other side, air them, understand them deeply as though they\u2019re your own, to really figure out what\u2019s best, especially in building a business. I think that\u2019s critical, right? If the goal is actually creating shareholder value, you want to understand. I\u2019m looking at this from the outside, and I do think that we\u2019re in a moment of this business\u2019s life where an outside perspective would be useful. It\u2019s hard to argue with how the stock price has performed and the business performance that some massive change is needed. So I\u2019m hopeful that I\u2019m bringing that fresh outside perspective.\n\nNonetheless, I\u2019ve got to acknowledge that I don\u2019t have all of the information and history and context that the existing management does, too. And so I\u2019m going to hear that out, wear that argument as though I\u2019m in there with them, and then come to what I believe is actually the right, best [conclusion]. You could think about a range of tracks for the plumbing of this. People talk about going private. Are there things to do with the debt? Are there things to do with other ways of financing or growing or shedding parts of the business? I laid out my current views in the letter, and hopefully you can share that with your audiences, because I do think \u2014 it\u2019s like six pages or so, but it\u2019s not exactly the way that CNN characterized the letter.\n\nNayeema: I think it\u2019s seven pages. And we did read the letter. You kind of outline a three- pronged strategy. You want to cut costs, you want to pivot to audio and video, and you want to bring a diversity of thought into the BuzzFeed equation. You mentioned publishers \u2014 content creators like Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, perhaps Aaron Rodgers. But I want to ask you, because there\u2019s this wave of conservative media\u2014\n\nVivek: Can I just pause you right there?\n\nNayeema: Of course.\n\nVivek: What you just described was exactly consistent with the rest of the media reporting on this, which the headline said [that I\u2019d] bring Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson in. I\u2019m just gonna pause right there for one second, because I think it\u2019s really, really important. Since you quoted my letter, I\u2019m gonna ask you to quote it correctly. I did not say Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Aaron Rodgers. I said, what you need is to have the courage to engage with the full cultural and political spectrum, from Candace Owens to Destiny, from Tucker Carlson to Bill Maher, from Aaron Rodgers to Charles Barkley. And so it\u2019s interesting that you just did the exact same thing.\n\nBen: Let me actually try to engage that criticism, because I think that\u2019s an interesting point. But I think the reason that that\u2019s the headline, is because if I said, \u201cI want Fox News to engage with Vivek Ramaswamy,\u201d that\u2019s not news, and that\u2019s extremely boring, because it\u2019s obvious. And if I say, \u201cI want Fox News to engage with, and to give Hunter Biden a show,\u201d that\u2019s news, because that\u2019s pretty surprising. News is often about things that are surprising, rather than things that are obvious. And the reason I think, at least from my perspective, that it\u2019s more interesting that you would bring Tucker Carlson to BuzzFeed than you would bring kind of a center-left mainstream person to BuzzFeed is because it\u2019s surprising. That\u2019s what defines news.\n\nVivek: It\u2019s a good conversation here. I just want to say one thing in response to that, right. Because Ben, you\u2019re a smart guy.\n\nBen: Flattery will get you everywhere.\n\nVivek: I\u2019ll give you that. But I think it\u2019s important to recognize this \u2014 I don\u2019t say this as a compliment here, I say it as somewhat of a criticism \u2014 is that you\u2019re able to elide the essence of what just happened there, and the essence of that media reporting, because you\u2019re right.\n\nBen: No, I think you\u2019re saying that we\u2019re being unfair to you by saying that the most interesting thing about your letter was the sort of rightward turn toward BuzzFeed. And I think that was authentically a really interesting thing. Can I ask you about the substance of it?\n\nVivek: The essence of the point, just to smoke it out: I think the thing that\u2019s actually really interesting, is the idea \u2014 forget whether you\u2019re platforming one individual or another, the whole thesis of that section of the letter, and what remains, in my view, a good opportunity for Buzzfeed to pursue \u2014 is to be bold by saying that we will engage with ideas across the cultural and political and lifestyle spectrum in a way that no major media business is doing today. [It\u2019s] not dunking on BuzzFeed by dancing on their grave with conservative voices. No.\n\nNayeema: In fact, that\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing.\n\nVivek: It\u2019s engaging in dialogue which I think we\u2019re missing, and it\u2019s useful, I hope.\n\nNayeema: It seems that part of the thesis that you have for a broadened media platform is that some of these conservative media platforms that have risen that would have only contained the three voices I just named \u2014 places like Parler, Gettr, Rumble, even Truth Social \u2014 they are struggling as a business. So this idea of catering to a single audience, as it were, is not working. Is that part of your premise of investment, that you really want it to be broad?\n\nVivek: There is an opportunity that\u2019s untapped. And the untapped opportunity, I think, is to have one platform where, on the same platform, you have different voices engaging. And I use the word platform a little bit imprecisely there, because what we\u2019re talking about here is actually a publisher, right, which is different than an X, or a Truth Social or any of these other platforms. It\u2019s the unique opportunity to create a publisher that actually does the service for its audience for screening for quality of content. That\u2019s an important service.\n\nBut it seems that every other publisher who\u2019s providing that service is providing another service that many audiences don\u2019t love, which is also screening for the ideology of what they\u2019re able to hear. So if you could separate those two things \u2014 of screening as a quality filter for what their audiences get, but affirmatively actually engaging with dissenting voices, not just on questions of news or politics, but across the cultural, ideological, sports, lifestyle spectrums \u2014 that\u2019s interesting to me. And the collective of all of those things that you named, in terms of actually incorporating diversity of thought into your own ranks, into the voices that you platform as a publisher, in terms of moving in the direction of content creation, and going in the direction of the creator economy, which I think is a more promising business direction than digitized print \u2014 you actually create something that BuzzFeed is missing today, which is really the only way for one of these businesses to differentiate itself. Which is a brand.\n\nRight now, most people know BuzzFeed, the name. Nobody knows what it actually means. And I think the ability to use some of the things that I suggested doing in the letter with humility, with an actual sense of grace and honesty, admitting some of the prior failures \u2014 the failures are obvious. It\u2019s like the ketchup stain on your shirt phenomenon; everybody sees it, but you actually can win your audience over if you\u2019re the person to admit it. Use that sense of vulnerability and honesty to build a brand that not only BuzzFeed but so many other media companies like it lack today.\n\nTo the extent you\u2019re gonna have a corporate player in media at all, I think brand is essential, because pretty soon, it\u2019s all going to be commoditized, if it isn\u2019t already, if not by AI already, by human beings who are behaving like AI, doing same same cut-and-paste reporting. The thing that\u2019s really going to differentiate a media company in the future is actually going to be the brand created by that human honesty, and using AI and other tools to actually manage the costs, in a way that this business just hasn\u2019t done to date. And so that\u2019s the way I\u2019m thinking about this.\n\nBen: I mean, it\u2019s a tough business that you\u2019re thinking about getting into, and one in which there are no new ideas. So we wish you luck, to the degree that we can figure [it out].\n\nNayeema: Vivek, you said that you got interested in media about a year and a half ago, but as I understand that you\u2019ve been here before. I don\u2019t think this has been previously reported, but you had a call, I think in late 2020, with Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and others, about rolling up a big internet company that would have included Parler and been an alternative to [Amazon Web Services], I believe. And you would have been CEO.\n\nVivek: I\u2019ve played around with a lot of concepts. One of those led to the birth of Strive, which is the financial services ecosystem. But you\u2019re right. After I left my job in biotech, ... I started a company in 2014, led it as CEO for seven years, ran it according to decentralized principles \u2014 [and] I see an opportunity to run a media company in the same way, give people skin in the game, bottom-up, align incentives. And that\u2019s a $8-$9 billion publicly-traded company today, that\u2019s returned over a billion and a half dollars in cash to shareholders, and it\u2019s traded on the NASDAQ. We just celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the company last month.\n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve been interested in for a long time is, how can I use some of those experiences to drive other change to the private sector. I briefly was intrigued by media. I decided to go the direction of financial services as my next stop. And so my own view is, when you think about driving change to the private sector, there\u2019s two sets of rails that really matter: communications and financial services. And I worry, also for our culture, that those are two of the rails that, forget who the government is in charge, lend themselves to problematic government capture, which is why you need robust, competitive, well-run private alternatives that prevent single viewpoint domination in either of those sets of rails. So I ended up dedicating myself actually, I threw the towel in media. Like you said, Ben, if you\u2019re doing it just for the pursuit of profit, there\u2019s better places to do that than in the media business. \u2026 So I went in the direction of financial services.\n\nBen: Pragmatic choice.\n\nVivek: After the presidential campaign, though, I interface so much with the media, that kind of pulled me really back in to say: You know what, if I was solely focused on personally maximizing the size of my bank account, I\u2019d probably pick other industries. But within media, is there an opportunity to really drive change and still maximize value relative to the price at which a business like BuzzFeed is trading and show that something can be run successfully with an alternative vision? Yes, that\u2019s what pulled me back in.\n\nNayeema: In retrospect, is that idea that you discussed with Peter and Elon and others an attractive idea? This kind of roll-up.\n\nVivek: I said this in the letter as well \u2014 people make this mistake. The idea of rolling up assets or divesting assets: that\u2019s not a strategy, that\u2019s a tactic. Right? You need a baseline strategy of what you\u2019re actually doing. And so, does the broad strategy of platforming multiple different kinds of voices and pursuing truth through the open exchange of ideas in a marketplace that lacks it? Is that a good strategy? I think it is, actually. I think a lot of consumers are hungry for it. I think it doesn\u2019t exist today. There\u2019s periods in the past in media where it\u2019s existed. I think it can exist in the future, but in the context of a new media content distribution landscape, nobody\u2019s really tapped that yet. So do I believe that strategy can work? Absolutely. And do I think running it as this multi-manager platform, which is the core model that I suggest for BuzzFeed to run itself \u2014 decentralized, give creators skin in the game, so you don\u2019t have to pay large upfront costs, give people that autonomy, rather than centrally mandating what they do, or don\u2019t do? Yes, I think that this is an opportunity to build a multibillion-dollar business. It\u2019s never going to be, probably, a trillion-dollar company as a publisher, but a multibillion-dollar business. I think that opportunity absolutely exists.\n\nNayeema: [The Free Press, the publication run by] our former colleague, Bari Weiss, raised a concern about the kind of revolving door of media and politics. [The Free Press] said this: \u201cA healthier political environment would be one in which politicians are politicians, and the media is the media.\u201d Vivek, which team do you want to be on? That was [their] question to you. What\u2019s your answer?\n\nVivek: I didn\u2019t see that. On the basic intuition of it, I generally tend to share [with] anybody who has a revulsion to a revolving door between politics and industry broadly, especially after you\u2019ve been in the seat of actually making public policy. I have deep aversion to [that]. And I think that that\u2019s not a left- or a right-wing intuition. I think there\u2019s people on the left and right who both share that. And so, you know what, if I\u2019d been the President of the United States, which is where I was running for, or if I\u2019d been in a policymaking position in the Senate, I probably shouldn\u2019t come back to the very industries that I had oversight over. I don\u2019t favor that kind of thing, all else equal. I mean, there could be exceptions here or there, maybe, but all else equal, as a general rule I agree with Bari, I\u2019d be against that.\n\nI am the other way around. I\u2019m an entrepreneur who volunteered to run this country, as U.S. president, as somebody who is patently outside of politics. And the beauty of our process is the people of this country get to decide who actually leads the country. But I\u2019m an entrepreneur at my core. And so I am continuing to do the thing I\u2019ve been doing for the last 15 years, which is building businesses, investing, writing books \u2014 I\u2019ve written three books in the past three years, and working on my fourth now \u2014 so the combination of that type of content creation, combined with business creation, makes the media a natural place not to ignore.\n\n(After this conversation, Vivek read the Free Press piece and realized he\u2019d misunderstood the context of the phrase \u201crevolving door\u201d in our conversation. He emailed: \u201cI\u2019m against the \u2018revolving door\u2019 between people who have served in the government and who go on to specifically monetize their government connections in public service through private business activities. To be clear, I have absolutely no problem with private sector leaders who go on to serve in government, or former public servants who go on to succeed in the private market independently \u2014 I\u2019d love to see more of both! But using your connections gained during government service to later enrich yourself is something I don\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cBut I see no philosophical problem with someone who aspires to public office becoming a publisher of content, or a publisher of content later running for public office. Our Founding Fathers certainly didn\u2019t see a problem with that. Alexander Hamilton founded the New York Post. Thomas Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin would certainly count as a \u201cpublisher\u201d or \u201ccontent creator\u201d in modern times - not to mention engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur too. They were polymath intellectuals who weren\u2019t confined to the lane of \u201cpolitician.\u201d I think we could use more of that Renaissance spirit in the class of people who lead our country today.\u201d\n\nBen: I think what [The Free Press] was talking about, though, was journalism. Almost everything you said right now, probably could have come out of my mouth or out of the mouth of the guy who runs CNN, or the New York Times editor: \u201cWe believe in having diverse voices.\u201d\n\nVivek: Ben, may I just\u2014\n\nBen: Yeah, of course.\n\nVivek: We\u2019re having a fun debate here.\n\nBen: But I mean, how abstract it is\u2014\n\nVivek: You used to run BuzzFeed News though, right?\n\nBen: Let me get to that. I promise I\u2019m getting there, and we can argue about the specifics, because I would just love to take it to specifics for a minute. The point I was just trying to make was that, I think when people talk about media news in the abstract, we all sort of say the same words. And there\u2019s actually a lot that I really liked in your letter in that context.\n\nBut I would say the thing that disappointed me a little were some of the specific criticisms. Because it seemed like somebody had sort of Googled \u201ccriticism of BuzzFeed stories,\u201d a lot of it actually from the left and almost totally at random, and said, \u201cWell, look, the World Wildlife Foundation was upset that BuzzFeed News reported, and then the Trump administration acted, on these questions on the way in which they were working with rangers who were killing people.\u201d It was a pretty good story. If that person that Googled it had read the Guardian story they linked, they would have seen that they conceded most of the substance of it. Similarly, there was a dispute with Robert Mueller. I was sort of surprised to see you on his side of it, but sure. There was a big dispute about the Steele dossier that I think is a totally reasonable one, that I\u2019ve written about at length.\n\nBut a really core part of owning, of working, in media, and working with journalists, is to have the backs of the reporters that you\u2019re working with. And to come in with what really seemed like pretty random and not particularly deeply researched criticism saying, \u201cHey, there\u2019s been criticism of a bunch of these stories, most of it from the left, some of it from the right,\u201d which sort of surprised me too \u2014 that just felt kind of facile, honestly, and not the way that somebody who wants to employ journalists ought to approach it.\n\nVivek: If I may respond \u2014 as you would acknowledge, of course, you\u2019re not an impartial observer of this.\n\nBen: No, no, of course not. That\u2019s literally true. And I do care a lot about that place.\n\nVivek: You were the editor of BuzzFeed News at a time when many of those criticisms came out. So, look, we all have our vantage points, and I just think it\u2019s worth acknowledging.\n\nBen: Sure, but mine is very close to the page on those. That\u2019s why I guess I\u2019m reacting. I have a very detailed knowledge.\n\nVivek: Which is a useful, there\u2019s, there\u2019s pros to being close to it too.\n\nBen: Understanding the details is a pro.\n\nVivek: You thought it was a facile criticism. Let me know when you\u2019re ready for a non-facile\u2014\n\nBen: I\u2019m ready for a profound response. Go for it.\n\nVivek: I can\u2019t promise profound, but I could promise you what I actually believe, which I think is a little bit more nuanced than what you laid out. First, the notion of saying that you\u2019d be surprised to see me offer criticisms from the left and from the right, itself reflects a misunderstanding of the intention. It reflects the same reason why you hear people airlifting Candace Owens and Tucker without mentioning Destiny and Bill Maher, which also came in the letter.\n\nBen: I think people mostly know you as a conservative political activist running for president.\n\nVivek: The point I was making is, there is a series of examples that have lost [BuzzFeed\u2019s] audience\u2019s trust. And BuzzFeed\u2019s audience did lose its trust in BuzzFeed. And at the time you left BuzzFeed News, I think you said something to the effect of \u201cBuzzFeed is in great shape, but I know that Jonah has committed to news.\u201d Within two years later, their stock price is in the toilet, they\u2019re loaded with debt, and they have shed their entire news business. So in a certain sense, what\u2019s the message to the journalists? It\u2019s: That model isn\u2019t working. Right? The historical model failed many journalists, who now do not have their job, because BuzzFeed News as a division does not exist.\n\n[crosstalk] BuzzFeed News does not exist, in part, because of those failures. And so it\u2019s not a left-wing or right-wing point or that I agree with Robert Mueller, or I agree with the left-wing critics of the WWF story. [The] point is that an audience[\u2019s] trust has been betrayed. That was an asset that was lost, that in part contributed to the closure of this news division.\n\nThe final point here is, I view all of this as the symptoms. You said I\u2019m saying the same thing that you might say or the head of CNN might say, or whatever, Mark Thompson or whoever else. Well, not quite, actually. I think that everything we\u2019re talking about, including a lot of those \u2014 what I would call, certainly, some journalistic failures. I give you credit, I read your piece in The Atlantic, you acknowledge you would have done some things differently. By the way, if Jonah said the same thing on behalf of BuzzFeed now, I think that would accrete massive trust and value to his business. But I don\u2019t think I am saying quite the same thing. Because if you say, \u201ctalk about diversity of thought,\u201d everybody says it. In that sense, you\u2019re right about it. I believe in facts. You said you want to get the facts. Let\u2019s get to hard facts. [crosstalk]\n\nIf you look at the employee contributions, where do employees contribute? That\u2019s public data, thankfully. Of all of the employee contributions that BuzzFeed has recorded publicly since 2010, it\u2019s not that 50-50 was to Democrat or Republican. We\u2019re talking over 99% in one direction, and less than 1% to Republicans. And I\u2019m not saying it has to be 50-50. But if you\u2019re running a business that claims to have diversity trainings, right \u2014 they offer mandatory diversity trainings \u2014 proclaims the importance of diversity of thought, as BuzzFeed does, and yet, 99.9 or 99.5% of your employee political contributions go in one direction? [crosstalk] And then you look at those journalistic failures through that lens\u2014\n\nBen: You should see their audience\u2019s political contributions. Like, really. I think, if you look at the audience of Huffington Post, you might also find that their political contributions tilted left. \u2026 I suspect the audience is in a similar place, which could be a problem when you\u2019re operating it.\n\nVivek: That\u2019s a self-fulfilling cycle, and that audience is shrinking versus what I\u2019m saying.\n\nBen: So do you fire the audience?\n\nVivek: You don\u2019t fire the audience, far from it, you attract the audience. You have already fired the audience. That\u2019s actually what\u2019s reflecting itself, is a business that is going down.\n\nBen: I think there are a lot of good points here, genuinely, but also this is, I do think that this was a bit of a kitchen sink, and having literally written the book about why the social news companies collapsed \u2014 honestly, I wish I could say it was because they were doing combative journalism that sometimes made people unhappy. But I think they couldn\u2019t afford that journalism, for a bunch of really interesting reasons you probably understand better than I do, because you went to business school, but that were fundamentally about a bad bet on the shape of the internet. And I agree with you, in some ways, about the way it\u2019s going. I think figuring out how media companies make money out of that is a complicated thing for another podcast.\n\nNayeema: Vivek, you keep coming back to this idea of diversity. And you\u2019re mentioning Bill Maher and Destiny, which were very much in your letter. But would you be open to more liberal, more progressive voices coming on the platform as well, as you\u2019re talking about diversifying it?\n\nVivek: Of course.\n\nNayeema: But you didn\u2019t mention any of those people in your letter that are kind of, let\u2019s say extreme left.\n\nVivek: I consider Destiny maybe in that.\n\nBen: Should we get Mehdi Hasan on there?\n\nNayeema: Yeah, would you have Mehdi?\n\nVivek: Sure. He\u2019s a smart guy, right? I think he\u2019s a smart guy, absolutely. You know, I think that we would pick at certain bones where we disagree with each other, but the screen would be quality, because I think quality matters, right? You got bad quality on the right, you got bad quality on the left. Screen for actual quality, but above that filter for quality, own the brand of saying that we\u2019re actually fostering as much diverse ideational exchange as we possibly can have.\n\nBen: But that\u2019s what I want Semafor\u2019s brand to be. You can\u2019t be giving them this advice.\n\nNayeema: Vivek is a millennial, taking back the millennial brand of BuzzFeed in a lot of ways.\n\nVivek: There\u2019s room for an ecosystem here.\n\nNayeema: There is one specific thing I want to say, because it\u2019s not just about being governed by the audience, or the people making the content, but there\u2019s also the basis of fact, right? And this is where I think [the] question of the revolving door comes in. Because what role would you play in this new ecosystem? You were on a presidential stage. You were saying that Jan. 6, \u201cnow does look like it was an inside job,\u201d something that has no basis in fact.\n\nVivek: We can go on the substance of that if you\u2019re interested.\n\nNayeema: It is the job of journalists to fact-check things like that. So as someone who\u2019s been in the political machine, somebody who has a now well-articulated public point of view out there \u2014 just like what you\u2019re saying 99.5% of BuzzFeed employees have, you have a very particular point of view. How is that point of view going to come into the operations of this business?\n\nVivek: I\u2019ll tell you what some of my own experiences have been in life and building businesses. If you look at, for example, the company that I mentioned before, a NASDAQ-traded multibillion-dollar business, by any measure, in 10 years, one of the most successful companies in the industry in a 10-year period \u2014 my number two, who became the number one \u2026 has probably more different political perspectives from me than either of you on this call. And yet, we worked incredibly well together to challenge each other and push each other to create a common purpose and mission in something that had nothing to do with the areas where he and I continue to spar, like good friends. We\u2019ll spar with bare knuckles today.\n\nAnd I miss that culture in America, actually, I miss that. That used to exist. I mean, that\u2019s part of who we are. I mean, our founding \u2014 this country was that, right? Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were sworn political enemies, but then spent the latter half of their lives writing letters to each other, that we\u2019re able to read for posterity. And those end up being better-written articles of opinions than anything we see in the modern landscape. So I want to bring that back. And so what I would say is the way I\u2019d want to run \u2014 I\u2019m not proposing to be the CEO of anything at this point.\n\nNayeema: Well, Elon and Peter thought you were good enough to be a CEO of a much bigger company.\n\nVivek: I\u2019ve been a CEO.\n\nNayeema: Of a media company, I should say, a bigger media company.\n\nVivek: The way I think BuzzFeed has an opportunity to run itself with the strategy that I\u2019ve offered here, is one in which its board, its management and its talent base include the best and brightest across \u2014 it\u2019s not just left versus right, because then we\u2019re just talking politics \u2014 across a wide range of axes, to create the kind of discourse that we\u2019re just missing today. And I think social media fails a little bit on this mark. I think the algorithmically supercharged nature of how the platforms are run lose[s] that filter of quality, which I think is a service to an audience.\n\nBen: Now you\u2019re singing our song. Every time you speak abstractly, I love it.\n\nNayeema: But the specifics matter\u2014\n\nVivek: I think we start from first principles. Sometimes all of us, myself, I\u2019m sure, included, are clouded by the strong feelings we have on a particular content-driven debate. \u2026 You could say, was it maybe even a bad idea to get into some of the specifics in the letter? If you look at how much it distracted people relative to what\u2019s in the heart of there, maybe I should have just left those out in the first letter. But the whole point is, I want to actually start from a bare-bones set of first principles, right? What\u2019s the principle? We believe in pursuing truth. We pursue truth through open ideas. Don\u2019t trust us. Trust the people you listen to and don\u2019t trust any one of them. Listen to all of them.\n\nNayeema: But here\u2019s the thing. Vivek, I agree with you on these principles. But you, as a presidential candidate, you either need to be the person saying the false things, the things the public wants to hear, or you need to be the person checking those things, catching those things, right? That\u2019s the Bari Weiss question.\n\nVivek: Nayeema, let me just say. This is just personally getting to know me, right? This is idiosyncratic and not, but it\u2019s fine \u2026 Whenever somebody \u2014 and this happened a lot in my life, it\u2019s probably happened to a lot of people, every person is watching this too, right, and this is outside of politics, but maybe in the realm of like career advice, unsolicited as it is \u2014 anytime somebody tells you, \u201cshut up, sit down, stay in your lane,\u201d I naturally recoil at that. I think some of the greatest things that have happened in American history and some of the greatest\u2014\n\nBen: This is such an abstract way to respond to a question about having said\u2014\n\nVivek: Crossing different boundaries. And so no, it\u2019s not an abstract question. You\u2019re saying you picked a lane. For a year, I was a presidential candidate, and I ran openly as an entrepreneur. I said, you know, you described me as part of the political machine. For anybody in the Republican Party who understands the way I ran well, calling me in any way\u2014\n\nBen: I think it\u2019s that you visibly felt the temptation to tell an audience what they want. To feel the temptation, that is unavoidable at every level of politics, to tell people what they want to hear when they want to hear it. Anyone who watches and I don\u2019t even mean this, anybody who watches any political campaign sees this.\n\nVivek: We can have that debate. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u2014 I\u2019m happy to go that way.\n\nBen: You know, we\u2019ll have it when you\u2019re my boss at that new (inaudible) BuzzFeed. I hope this job interview went well.\n\nNayeema: I\u2019m curious, would you bring Ben Smith back to run? Would you, are you going to relaunch?\n\nVivek: I\u2019m not planning or volunteering to be a CEO of it, but let\u2019s just play this out. Let\u2019s say this is the kind of conversation \u2014 this is the kind of conversation I want to be having within a media company.\n\nNayeema: But these conversations happen, Vivek. I think that\u2019s the thing, Vivek. These kinds of conversations happen at media companies.\n\nVivek: I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s possible, Nayeema, in a context in which 99.5% of your employees\u2019 political contributions are going in a direction that 50% of your country disagrees with. And I think if you\u2019re really premised on the true, open exchange of ideas, that just couldn\u2019t possibly be the case on the fact that\u2014 I\u2019m not saying it has to be 50%, but it is a joke. It is a farce. And I think it is no accident that the first paper the first publication to break the Steele dossier, that would have not happened if it was 99.5%, or 70%, even 50% in the other direction. I think there would be inherent checks and balances in creating cultural debate.\n\nBen: I do think you really\u2014\n\nVivek: The goal is to cross start from a blank slate and ask what\u2019s possible if you\u2019re starting from first principles.\n\nBen: I mean, I think you\u2019ll have an interesting\u2014\n\nVivek: First principles should be an open exchange of ideas with actual diversity of thought.\n\nBen: I do think you\u2019ll...\n\nVivek: Which I think is missing in most media organizations, left and right, today.\n\nBen: I mean, I do think you\u2019ll have hopefully interesting conversations with Jonah Peretti about this, because it\u2019s, the ideology of journalists is often, you know, demented in various ways, but rarely on a left-right spectrum. My own, in fact, in my own self criticism here, is this sort of radicalism about publishing the thing sometimes, you know, in any direction. But I do think that, I think I look forward to your digging in a little on this. When we said people who come out of politics often kind of project political motives, the way journalists often project political motives onto entrepreneurs. I think you see it all over the place, actually. And so, I look forward to the education of Vivek Ramaswamy on the inside of media businesses.\n\nNayeema: We should have a follow up.\n\nBen: This was really, this was really interesting.\n\nNayeema: We should genuinely have a follow up on this.\n\nBen: I think these things on the inside are often not what they look like from the outside. I mean, for better and for worse, for sure.\n\nVivek: If I could just finish in response to one of the points from that Nayeema made earlier, because I think it\u2019s interesting. It goes, it\u2019s important to me as a human being, but I think it\u2019s also important to the essential fluid of our country, actually, is our country was built by pioneers and explorers who were actually Renaissance men that didn\u2019t fall into the pre-categorized lanes where you\u2019re supposed to operate. Benjamin Franklin invented the lightning rod. He invented the Franklin stove. He invented a remedy for the common cold.\n\nNayeema: He was a satirist. Yeah, yeah.\n\nVivek: You got Thomas Jefferson, he invented the polygraph test, the swivel chair, he was 33 when he wrote the Declaration, you got guys like Livingston who were ambassadors to France while tinkering around creating the steamship with Robert Fulton. And it\u2019s, I prefer to kind of close on at least a positive point here. We\u2019re talking about business building business or even rebuilding an industry in that, I think we would just all do better, myself included, but maybe if I may invite others who are willing to participate, to sort of take off those preconceived shackles not just on partisan politics...\n\nBen: Vivek, I think, on this note, I do think I\u2019m gonna run, I\u2019ve always wanted to run for president. And I think that\u2019s what...\n\nVivek: From first principles, that\u2019s what our founders did. And if we\u2019re rebuilding media, I think there\u2019s an opportunity to approach it with that spirit of the founders.\n\nNayeema: Three observations. By the way, I agree with you one should not necessarily, in their career, stay in a lane. I do also think that you had the same reaction that Bari had about the revolving door between...\n\nVivek: The corruption and politics, I agree with that.\n\nNayeema: And once you\u2019re a practicing policymaker, and third, I do think Ben, you have a bright political future in front of you. If you\u2019re not going back to BuzzFeed with Vivek, which is also, I think, an option.\n\nBen: I think I\u2019m gonna stay in my lane here. But thank you for coming on Vivek, we appreciate it.\n\nVivek: You don\u2019t have a lane Ben, you\u2019re boundless, too, I believe in you.\n\nBen: I look forward to our conversation about being your vice presidential nominee.\n\nVivek: I respected your article in The Atlantic. I think the fact that you were able to, I don\u2019t agree with everything you even said in that article, but the fact that you could still go back and reflect and say, at least with the Steele dossier reporting, there are some things we could have done differently. I think it\u2019s a good thing. And my advice to Jonah, I haven\u2019t spoken to him yet, but my advice would be, take a kernel of that humility and use that to advance your own self interest in building a brand. And if so, I think that\u2019s a big part of how we run BuzzFeed.\n\nBen: I would love to be a fly on the wall in that in that conversation, but I doubt you will invite me but thank you for, Thank you, thank you for taking the time.\n\nNayeema: Thank you, Vivek.\n\nVivek: Thanks, guys. Take care.",

      "news": "Fresh back from a weeklong recess, Representative John W. Rose, Republican of Tennessee, was fired up and among the first to speak on the House floor on Monday, when he used his five minutes of floor time to castigate the criminal conviction of former President Donald J. Trump.\n\nBut the most memorable part of his earnest speech was not Mr. Rose\u2019s words. Rather, a sideshow was unfolding behind him in the chamber entirely without his knowledge, courtesy of his young son, who put on a scene of silliness that quickly took off on social media, where dozens of viewers began circulating video of the shenanigans.\n\nAs Mr. Rose intoned the familiar lines of attack that rank-and-file Republicans have recited during television appearances and social media posts in the days since Mr. Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts, entering them into the Congressional Record, his son Guy, age 6, was putting on a performance of his own.\n\nSeated directly behind his father and well within the frame of the C-SPAN cameras that record every moment the House is in session, the young Mr. Rose pantomimed and mugged, rolled his eyes and stuck his tongue out, and generally hammed it up in a display that is likely to be remembered longer than any of his father\u2019s words.",

      "news": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Wisconsin attorney general on Tuesday filed charges against three allies of Donald Trump accused of taking part in the effort to put forth a slate of fake electors and usurp the 2020 presidential election, according to online court records.\n\nThe men \u2013 Kenneth Chesebro, a right-wing attorney who helped devise the fake elector plot; Jim Troupis, a former Trump lawyer; and Michael Roman, a former Trump campaign official \u2013 are each facing a single forgery charge.\n\nWisconsin is the latest state to bring charges against people connected to the former president involved in the broad effort to overturn the presidential election results. State prosecutors in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia also have brought charges against a swath of Trump\u2019s allies.\n\nAn attorney for Chesebro declined to comment. CNN has reached out to attorneys for Troupis and Roman.\n\nDemocratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers issued a one word response to the charges Tuesday: \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nCNN previously reported that Chesebro was helping investigators in at least four states, including Wisconsin, who were looking into the fake electors scheme. Chesebro\u2019s lawyers had believed that his cooperation would be enough for him to stave off charges.\n\nLast year, the 10 fake electors from Wisconsin disavowed their attempt to overturn Trump\u2019s defeat in 2020, recognized the legitimacy of President Joe Biden\u2019s victory, and pledged not to serve as real electors in 2024 or any election when Trump is on the ballot \u2013 or to act as sham electors in any future election, as part of a civil lawsuit settlement.\n\nThe 10 fake electors issued a statement acknowledging that the phony certificates they signed in December 2020 were \u201cused as part of an attempt to improperly overturn\u201d the lawful election results.\n\n\u201cWe hereby reaffirm that Joseph R. Biden, Jr. won the 2020 presidential election and that we were not the duly elected presidential electors for the State of Wisconsin for the 2020 presidential election,\u201d says a portion of their statement. \u201cWe oppose any attempt to undermine the public\u2019s faith in the ultimate results of the 2020 presidential election.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen, Katelyn Polantz, Zachary Cohen and Alison Main contributed to this report.",

      "title": "N.Y. lawmakers poised to grant immunity to sex workers who witness a crime",
      "news": "As New York lawmakers prepare for hours of debate in the last scheduled week of session, a bill expected to easily clear both houses in the next few days would grant immunity to sex workers and survivors of human trafficking who help law enforcement with a criminal investigation.\n\nThe bipartisan-backed sex worker immunity bill is unrelated to decriminalizing sex work in New York, but would protect sex workers from going to jail for reporting a crime to law enforcement.\n\nSex workers, victims of prostitution of sex trafficking, commonly have a crime committed against them or become aware of a crime, but fear the repercussions of going to jail themselves if they discuss it with police or medical professionals.\n\n\"The law is really comprehensive in that way to make sure that people have access to health care, to law enforcement, without being arrested themselves,\" said Jared Trujillo, a former sex worker from New York City.\n\nTrujillo, who works as an associate professor at CUNY School of Law, said the immunity bill would benefit female and LGBTQ-plus sex workers who are victims of sexual violence the most frequently.\n\n\"The ability to sexually victimize these folks is even higher,\" Trujillo said. \"One thing that this bill also does is it takes off that coercion. It takes out that 'Hey, if you do this for me, I won't arrest you.' It takes that off of the table. So it should make sex workers a lot more comfortable reporting violence agianst them or something that they experiences or that they see.\"\n\nThe measure, on the floor calendar of both houses of the Legislature, ensures sex workers' immunity through every step of prosecution, protects sex workers who live or work together and includes prostitution that occurs in a school zone.\n\nLaw enforcement, district attorneys and lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle support the change and say it will aid in criminal cases and end sexual violence sooner.\n\n\"It's a human rights bill, plain and simple,\" Assembly sponsor Anna Kelles said Monday. \"Regardless of who someone is, we would want them to have basic human rights and basic protections.\"\n\nThe bill picked up steam in the Legislature in wake of the New York architect suspected of killing multiple women on Long Island's Gilgo Beach.\n\n\"There is some evidence that that would have been addressed about 10 years earlier because there was evidecne that sex workers had to address some of the issues and help the investigation,\" the assemblywoman said.\n\nKelles said the conversation is changing about seeing sex workers as human beings who must receive the proper protections.\n\nRepublicans in both houses widely support the legislation, though not unanimously.\n\nState Sen. Dean Murray, an East Patchogue Republican, plans to vote in favor of the bill, and said sex workers who've been abused or have knowledge of crimes should not be afraid of speaking with authorities.\n\n\"With this in place, this will let them know you're safe \u2014 you're free to talk to authorities without the threat of being charged for something that could be somewhat unrelated,\" Murray said.",

      "title": "Live updates: Hunter Biden gun trial opening statements",
      "news": "Hunter Biden arrives with his wife Melissa Cohen Biden to the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building on June 4, 2024 in Wilmington, Delaware. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nAfter both sides delivered opening statements, prosecutors called their first witness, FBI special agent Erika Jensen, Tuesday in Hunter Biden's trial on felony gun charges.\n\nJensen will be used by the prosecutors to introduce much of the digital evidence in this case, including embarrassing and intensely personal messages and images from Hunter Biden's laptop.\n\nHere's what's happened in the trial so far:\n\nProsecution's opening statement: Prosecutors began Tuesday with a fiery opening statement in the Hunter Biden trial. Prosecutor Derek Hines said that Biden was addicted to crack and lied on a federal form about his addiction when buying a gun. \u201cWe\u2019re here because of the defendant\u2019s lies and choices,\u201d Hines said. \u201cNo one is above the law. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are or what your name is.\u201d Prosecutors also told the jury about Hunter Biden\u2019s memoir. They quoted him describing his \u201csuperpower of finding crack anywhere, anytime.\u201d Turning to the jury, Hines said, \u201cthose are [Hunter\u2019s] words.\u201d Prosecutors also showed pictures of drugs to the jury that they got from Hunter\u2019s electronic devices.\n\nDefense's opening statement: Defense attorney Abbe Lowell highlighted the word \u201cknowingly\u201d in the charges brought against Hunter Biden as he began his opening statement Tuesday. Lowell said that prosectors had \u201cleft out the word\u201d and argued it is a key part of the case. In addition, he said, out of the 11 days Hunter Biden possessed the firearm, it was only out of a lockbox one day. \u201cThey have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunter knowingly violated the law,\u201d Lowell said, adding that what Hunter thought at the time was key. The defense also suggested that Hunter Biden didn\u2019t have much interest in buying a gun, trying to undermine prosecutors\u2019 claims that he knowingly lied to the gun dealers.\n\nJuror dismissed: One juror was dismissed from the Hunter Biden trial Tuesday after they sent an email to the court explaining that they live an hour away from where the trial is taking place in Wilmington, Delaware. The judge entered the courtroom at 8:55 a.m. ET and began by saying, \u201cso, we lost a juror.\u201d",

      "title": "Former Trump aides charged in Wisconsin over 2020 elector plot",
      "news": "MADISON, Wis. \u2014 Wisconsin\u2019s attorney general filed conspiracy charges Tuesday against a former aide and two attorneys who advised President Donald Trump over a meeting of Republicans claiming to be the state\u2019s 2020 presidential electors even though Trump had lost the state. The charges are the first in Wisconsin related to the meeting of electors. Prosecutors have separately charged Republicans who were involved in similar efforts in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Georgia.\n\nWisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul (D) charged Trump campaign aide Michael Roman and attorneys Kenneth Chesebro and James Troupis with one felony count each of conspiracy to commit forgery, according to the criminal complaints.\n\nKaul said at a news conference on the steps of the state Capitol his investigation could result in more charges. Asked about the possibility of charges against the former president, Kaul said, \u201cAs I said, I\u2019m not going to speak to any specific individual, but the investigation is ongoing, and decisions will be made based on the facts and the law, not on the identity of any individual.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf convicted, each faces a maximum sentence of six years in prison and a $10,000 fine. They are slated to make initial court appearances in September, and their cases will probably stretch past this fall\u2019s election unless they reach plea deals.\n\nTroupis and Chesebro did not immediately respond to messages. Roman\u2019s attorney, Kurt Altman, said he and Roman just learned of the charges and are reviewing them.\n\nAfter narrowly losing the 2020 election in Wisconsin, Trump sought recounts in the state\u2019s two most Democratic areas and used that process to try to throw out hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots. The state Supreme Court rejected his efforts on Dec. 14, 2020, the day presidential electors around the country were to meet.\n\nAn hour after that ruling, 10 Republicans gathered in the state Capitol to sign paperwork claiming they were the state\u2019s true electors. Trump allies held similar meetings in six other states and then sent official-looking paperwork claiming to be their states\u2019 true electors to Congress, the National Archives and others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters used those filings to falsely claim the outcome of the 2020 election was in doubt and try to prevent Congress from certifying the results. Their efforts culminated with the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTroupis, Chesebro and Roman helped develop the elector strategy, according to public records. Troupis served a brief stint as a judge and has long been a go-to lawyer for Wisconsin Republicans; he was Trump\u2019s lead attorney for the recount and legal challenge in Wisconsin.\n\nChesebro helped devise the overall plan and documented the Wisconsin meeting on his cellphone, according to photos and records. He wrote memos to Troupis soon after the election that provided the framework for having Republicans meet in states that Trump lost to Joe Biden.\n\nChesebro was charged last year with racketeering and other crimes in Georgia. and as part of a deal pleaded guilty in October to a felony count of conspiring to file false documents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoman served as Trump\u2019s director of Election Day operations in 2020, and in that role helped coordinate the plans for Republicans to meet as electors in states Trump lost. He has been charged with racketeering and other crimes in Georgia, and conspiracy, forgery and other crimes in Arizona. He has pleaded not guilty in Georgia and is expected to do the same Friday in Arizona.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) released a one-word statement about the news of the charges: \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nWisconsin\u2019s attorney general took a slower and more targeted approach to his investigation compared to those in other states. Unlike his counterparts, Kaul did not charge any of the 10 Wisconsin Republicans who signed the elector paperwork and instead went after those who arranged for them to meet.\n\nAmong those who signed the paperwork was Andrew Hitt, the chairman of the state Republican Party at the time. In December, he said he and the others \u201cwere tricked and misled into participating in what became the alternate elector scheme and would have never taken any actions had we known that there were ulterior reasons beyond preserving an ongoing legal strategy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHitt made the comment after reaching a settlement with two of the state\u2019s true electors who filed a lawsuit against Republicans. Under the settlement, Hitt and the others agreed not to serve as electors any time Trump is on the ballot and told the National Archives they were rescinding their false paperwork claiming to be electors.\n\nTroupis and Chesebro reached a separate settlement in March in that lawsuit. As part of the agreement, they released hundreds of pages of documents about the endeavor.",

Yet, he is undeterred from his effort to reclaim the presidency in a rematch with Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThe public understands and understands what\u2019s going on. This is a scam, this is a rigged trial,\u201d Trump said at Trump Tower on Friday.\n\nWhat You Need To Know Former President Donald Trump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records\n\n\n\nThe Trump campaign has raised more than $52 million following the verdict\n\n\n\nPresident Biden cautioned against calling trial 'rigged'\n\nIt\u2019s close and it may stay that way through November \u2014 felonies be damned.\n\n\u201cFor most people, the decision already reinforces what they already think,\u201d Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Poll, said.\n\nJust days before the verdict was announced, Marist was polling registered voters around the country about the presidential election and asked how a conviction would affect their vote.\n\nThe results:\n\n67% of registered voters said it would make no difference to their vote if Trump is found guilty\n\n17% said they would be less likely to vote for him\n\n15% said they would be more likely to vote for him\n\n\u201cThe kind of people right now who are saying they are less likely to vote for Trump, it\u2019s some of the persuadable groups, it\u2019s independent voters, it\u2019s younger voters,\u201d Miringoff said.\n\nWhile Trump fumes in front of the cameras, his campaign tries to make the best of a bad situation \u2014 announcing on Friday a nearly $35 million fundraising haul after the verdict. Later in the evening, the campaign reported even more donations, totaling $52.8 million.\n\nRepublican strategist Chapin Fay said Trump\u2019s airing of grievances is good for fundraising, but not enough to win.\n\n\u201cIf he is litigating his conviction every day, and that\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s talking about, I think substantively the campaign will have a problem pulling off a victory that way,\u201d Fay said. \u201cBut if he talks and makes this more about Joe Biden, then the conviction will matter less.\u201d\n\nBiden made his first public remarks on the verdict from the White House on Friday, speaking about the process instead of the politics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reckless, it\u2019s dangerous, and it\u2019s irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don\u2019t like the verdict,\u201d Biden said.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler put out a statement saying, \u201cAmerica just witnessed a confused, desperate and defeated Donald Trump ramble about his own personal grievances and lie about the American justice system, leaving anyone watching with one obvious conclusion: this man cannot be President of the United States.\u201d",

      "title": "Takeaways from Day 1 of Hunter Biden\u2019s trial",
      "news": "Wilmington, Delaware CNN \u2014\n\nGuns, addiction and politics hung over jury selection at Hunter Biden\u2019s criminal trial Monday, with at-times emotional questioning that resulted in the selection of a diverse 12-member panel.\n\nThroughout the day at the federal courthouse in Wilmington, prospective jurors were asked for their thoughts on the politicization of the criminal justice system, the state of US gun laws and their relationships with people struggling with addiction.\n\nThese topics will weigh heavily in the case against Hunter Biden, who made history Monday by becoming the first child of a sitting US president to go on trial. He pleaded not guilty to unlawfully buying and possessing a firearm while abusing drugs, which is against federal law. Hunter Biden is a recovering alcohol and crack cocaine addict.\n\nThe final 12-member jury is evenly split between six men and six women. A majority of the panel is Black, according to CNN\u2019s observations. There are also four alternates.\n\nOpening statements are set for 9 a.m. ET Tuesday, where prosecutors will spell out their allegations that Hunter Biden was an active drug user when he bought a revolver at a Wilmington gun shop in October 2018. They have contemporaneous texts and testimony from three of his romantic partners who, they say, can back up their case.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s attorneys take issue with the case itself \u2013 they claim special counsel David Weiss was motivated by political bias against the president. But Judge Maryellen Noreika blocked them from arguing this to the jury. So, their defense will likely focus on narrower questions about the definition of \u201caddict\u201d and the forms involved in the gun purchase.\n\nHere are takeaways from the first day of Hunter Biden\u2019s long-awaited trial:\n\nPain of addiction takes center stage\n\nThroughout the day, prospective jurors opened up about their loved ones who struggled with addiction, in front of a fully packed courtroom with reporters from around the world.\n\nSeveral of those jurors, who all hail from Delaware, made it onto the final jury panel.\n\nOne woman on the jury said her sister was a \u201crecovering addict\u201d who was previously convicted of drug crimes and credit card fraud and did time in Delaware state prison.\n\nAnother woman who is on the jury said her best friend from childhood died from a heroin overdose. One man who wasn\u2019t picked for the jury had trouble getting the words out when he talked about his nephew\u2019s multiple stints in and out of rehab.\n\nThis all ties into the case because prosecutors will need to zero in on Hunter Biden\u2019s long-acknowledged struggles with addiction to win a conviction. They plan to highlight deeply personal and traumatic messages that he exchanged with family, where he fought about his sobriety, and said drugs \u201cruined every relationship I\u2019ve ever cherished.\u201d\n\nHow the jurors interpret Hunter\u2019s addiction may determine the verdict.\n\nJurors were also pressed on another key aspects of the case: guns\n\nThe jury pool included a wide range of views on gun rights in the US, with some saying certain firearms \u2013 like so-called assault weapons \u2013 should be banned and others praising the Second Amendment.\n\nSeveral jurors selected said they owned a firearm, one of whom had a concealed carry license and said he believed \u201cour Second Amendment right is very important, and I stand with it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about her views on drugs and gun ownership, a woman selected said people who smoke marijuana should be allowed to own firearms, saying that \u201cweed, to me, isn\u2019t as bad as\u201d other drugs, like heroin.\n\nAnother juror selected as an alternate said she believed that mental health evaluations should be part of the process to possess a firearm, citing school shootings and saying that gun laws should be \u201cmore strict.\u201d\n\nA family affair\n\nThis is personal for the Bidens.\n\nPresident Biden issued a rare statement about his son\u2019s case. And first lady Jill Biden was in the courtroom throughout the day, sitting in the pews, a few feet from Hunter, as she celebrated her 73rd birthday.\n\n\u201cI am the President, but I am also a Dad,\u201d President Biden\u2019s statement said. \u201cJill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter\u2019s resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.\u201d\n\nThe president was clear to say that \u201cI don\u2019t and won\u2019t comment on pending federal cases,\u201d and didn\u2019t say anything about the prosecutors or their motivations in going after his son.\n\nAs president, if Biden wanted to shut down this case, he could do so today, by issuing a full pardon to Hunter. But the White House has repeatedly and explicitly ruled that out.\n\nIn the courtroom in Wilmington, the first lady was flanked her daughter Ashley Biden and by Hunter\u2019s current wife Sandi Cohen. Also sitting in the same row was Kevin Morris, the Hollywood lawyer who has bankrolled Hunter Biden\u2019s lofty legal bills over the past several years.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kit Maher and Macayla Cook contributed to this report.",

      "news": "South Korea takes steps to resume military activities on its border with North Korea as tensions rise over Pyongyang\u2019s launch of trash-carrying balloons.\n\nTensions are once again rising on the Korean peninsula after North Korea launched hundreds of balloons carrying rubbish and manure across towns and cities in South Korea, including onto the runway of Seoul\u2019s main airport.\n\nThe South Korean government responded on Tuesday by suspending a 2018 inter-Korean military deal aimed at easing front-line animosities.\n\nThe move will allow Seoul to resume large-scale military training near the border and restart propaganda broadcasts, including K-pop songs and outside news from loudspeakers stationed at the frontier.\n\nWhy did North Korea send balloons filled with rubbish into South Korea?\n\nThe North Korean campaign began last week on Tuesday, with Pyongyang flying some 260 balloons carrying cigarette butts, scraps of cloth, waste paper and manure into South Korea. The balloons \u2013 carried by the wind \u2013 fell across the country, including as far south as the county of Geochang, some 218 kilometres (135 miles) south of Seoul, according to the Yonhap news agency.\n\nThe campaign was also accompanied by North Korean attempts to jam GPS systems in South Korea.\n\nThe South Korean military called the acts \u201cbase\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d and deployed explosive ordnance disposal units and chemical and biological warfare response teams to inspect and collect the rubbish bags. It also issued alerts warning residents to keep away and report any sightings to authorities, but later said the material tied to the balloons did not contain any dangerous substances.\n\nOn Wednesday, North Korea said the balloons were launched in retaliation for an ongoing propaganda campaign by North Korean defectors and activists in South Korea, who regularly send inflatables containing anti-Pyongyang leaflets, food, medicine, money and USB sticks loaded with K-pop music videos and dramas across the border.\n\nKim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and a powerful ruling party official, issued a statement via the Korean Central News Agency, condemning Seoul as \u201cshameful, brazen\u201d for criticising the balloons while defending its citizens\u2019 own freedom of expression. North Korea\u2019s balloons were \u201cgifts of sincerity\u201d for South Koreans who \u201ccry for freedom of expression\u201d, she claimed.\n\nNorth Korea is extremely sensitive to the leaflets that South Korean activists float across the border, because they carry information about the outside world and criticism of the three-generation Kim dynasty\u2019s rule since the founding of North Korea by Kim Il Sung in 1948.\n\nIn 2020, the Korean People\u2019s Army was dispatched by Pyongyang to blow up an empty, South Korean-built liaison office on its territory in Kaesong in protest at South Korean civilian leafletting campaigns. The Inter Korean Liaison Office had been closed and evacuated in January that year, during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSeoul tried to address North Korea\u2019s concerns that year, approving a law that made the sending of anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets a crime, punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine of 30 million won ($21,765). But in 2023, South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court struck down the legislation calling it an excessive restriction of free speech.\n\nIs North Korea\u2019s balloon campaign continuing?\n\nOn Sunday, days after the first North Korean rubbish balloons arrived in South Korea, Seoul\u2019s military said it had collected a further 700 rubbish bags sent from North Korea.\n\nThe new launch prompted South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol to convene a meeting of his National Security Council, which promised \u201cunendurable\u201d measures in response. The council also condemned the balloons, and simultaneous GPS jamming, as an \u201cirrational act of provocation\u201d.\n\nHours later, on Sunday night, Kim Kang Il, a North Korean vice defence minister, said Pyongyang would temporarily suspend its balloon activities. He said North Korea had sent 3,500 balloons carrying 15 tonnes of wastepaper, and claimed the campaign had left the South Koreans with \u201cenough experience\u201d of the unpleasantness and effort of having to remove scattered rubbish.\n\nIf South Korean activists were to float anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets across the border again, however, he warned that North Korea would \u201ccorrespond to it by intensively scattering wastepaper and rubbish a hundred times the amount of scattered leaflets and the number of cases\u201d.\n\nThe suspension appeared to have come too late, however.\n\nOn Tuesday this week, the South Korean government discontinued the 2018 inter-Korean military agreement, saying the large-scale floating of balloons had \u201cseriously threatened the safety of our people and caused property damage\u201d.\n\nCho Chang-rae, South Korea\u2019s deputy defence minister for policy, said the \u201cresponsibility for this situation lies solely with North Korea\u201d. He added: \u201cIf North Korea launches additional provocations, our military, in conjunction with the solid South Korea-United States defence posture, will punish North Korea swiftly, strongly and to the end.\u201d\n\nWhat does the suspension of the 2018 deal mean?\n\nThe 2018 agreement was reached during a brief period of reconciliation between Kim and then-liberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\nUnder the pact, both countries agreed to \u201ccompletely cease all hostile acts against each other\u201d, including propaganda broadcasts and military drills near their heavily fortified border.\n\nThe agreement has already been in danger of collapsing.\n\nTensions spiked in November last year after South Korea responded to North Korea\u2019s launch of a spy satellite by announcing it would partially suspend the deal and resume aerial surveillance along their militarised border. North Korea then declared it was no longer bound by the deal, and deployed troops and weapons at guard posts that it had previously dismantled.\n\nPyongyang has yet to respond to Seoul\u2019s decision to fully suspend the 2018 accord.\n\nBut South Korea\u2019s resumption of firing exercises or propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts will likely prompt North Korea to take similar or stronger steps along the rivals\u2019 tense border.",

      "title": "In Shift, Biden Issues Order Allowing Temporary Border Closure to Migrants",
      "news": "President Biden issued an executive order on Tuesday that prevents migrants from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border when crossings surge, a dramatic election-year move to ease pressure on the immigration system and address a major concern among voters.\n\nThe order is the most restrictive border policy instituted by Mr. Biden, or any other modern Democrat, and echoes an effort in 2018 by President Donald J. Trump to cut off migration that was blocked in federal court.\n\nThe restrictions kick in once the seven-day average for illegal entries hits 2,500 per day. Daily totals already exceed that number, which means that Mr. Biden\u2019s executive order could go into effect right away \u2014 allowing border officers to return migrants across the border into Mexico or to their home countries within hours or days.\n\nTypically, migrants who cross illegally and claim asylum are released into the United States to wait for court appearances, where they can plead their cases. But a huge backlog means those cases can take years to come up.",
