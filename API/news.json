      "content": "Using graphics to illustrate the scope of U.S. foreign aid spending and analyzing how the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping cuts could play out across the world.\n\nIn a matter of weeks, President Donald Trump has moved to dismantle a vast international aid system built up by Republican and Democratic administrations over decades. More than $60 billion in foreign assistance has been frozen for 90 days, pending a government review. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the U.S. Agency for International Development may be abolished. On Friday, a federal judge blocked the administration from placing about 2,7000 staffers on paid leave and recalling nearly all of those posted abroad.\n\nIn a letter to lawmakers last week, Rubio cited \u201cconflicting, overlapping, and duplicative\u201d activities by USAID resulting in \u201cdiscord in the foreign policy and foreign relations of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cCLOSE IT DOWN,\u201d Trump posted Friday on social media.\n\nWithout U.S. support, humanitarian experts warn that already precarious global aid efforts could collapse, putting millions of lives at risk. Some former government officials said the sudden changes would undercut U.S. foreign policy and national security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are not only less safe, but we have abandoned people all over the world,\u201d said Brittany Brown, a former USAID official.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump\u2019s former USAID counselor Chris Mulligan condemned the funding pause. \u201cEvery minute that assistance is frozen weakens America, makes us less secure and costs us jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of U.S. foreign assistance and a look at how the new administration\u2019s sweeping cuts could play out across the world.\n\nThe U.S. government is the world\u2019s single largest humanitarian donor, according to the United Nations, though foreign assistance represented less than 1 percent of the congressional budget in fiscal 2023. That adds up to about $210 a year for the average taxpayer, compared with more than $2,800 per year for defense.\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman introduced the country\u2019s first major foreign aid package in the aftermath of World War II, arguing that strategic assistance could insulate states against the spread of communism. A decade later, President John F. Kennedy signed the Foreign Assistance Act into law and created USAID by executive order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKey allies, such as Ukraine, Israel and Egypt, rely on U.S. funding to secure their borders and protect shared interests. Other top recipients, including Jordan, Iraq and countries across sub-Saharan Africa, rely on American aid to combat the debilitating effects of war, drought and disease.\n\nExperts warn that the 90-day funding pause could be particularly devastating for countries on the brink of famine, such as Sudan. The World Food Program there relies on the United States for more than 60 cents of every dollar spent on aid.\n\n\u201cThe United States is the financial foundation of the entire humanitarian system,\u201d said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Humanitarian Research Lab at the Yale School of Public Health. \u201cHow will the house stand if you rip down the foundation?\u201d\n\nGlobal health and food aid\n\nA third of the U.S. foreign aid budget in 2023 was spent on emergency food and global health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Ethiopia, the largest recipient of U.S. food assistance, WFP estimates that over 15 million people rely on emergency aid, following a years-long drought that wrecked crops and an armed conflict in Tigray that left communities on the brink of famine.\n\nThe majority of people receive direct food aid, rather than cash, which means that working supply chains are vital to staving off hunger.\n\nAlthough Rubio issued a waiver to exempt emergency food programs from the 90-day aid pause, WFP administrators said the entire production line in Ethiopia has ground to a halt.\n\nWarehouses in Djibouti are stocked with next month\u2019s food supply, but truck drivers and program officers have been fired, furloughed or ordered to stop work. Without transportation or staff, palettes of taxpayer-funded flour, lentils and iodized salt may go to waste.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAid workers say they have been given no guidance from administrators on whether essential workers can return.\n\n\u201cThey got rid of all the senior lawyers,\u201d said a senior USAID civil servant, now placed on administrative leave, speaking like others in this story on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \u201cThe people who would be working to clarify these things aren\u2019t around.\u201d\n\nAn internal WFP memo viewed by The Washington Post warned of an \u201cimminent\u201d break in Ethiopia\u2019s emergency assistance pipeline. Officials fear the disruption could set off a chain reaction of violence, starvation and migration.\n\nThe impact on global health could be just as swift and far-reaching. Multimillion-dollar programs to combat malaria, Ebola and tuberculosis have been put on hold. Some U.S.-funded clinics were ordered to close. And medical providers that receive U.S. support said that they have started to ration supplies or halt nonessential services in anticipation of funding gaps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re reading that an agency is closing down, but it\u2019s not an agency: It\u2019s someone for people to see when they go into labor or their child gets sick with malaria,\u201d said Colin Puzo Smith, director of global policy at the nonpartisan advocacy group Results.\n\nOver the past decade, there\u2019s been a bipartisan effort to give local communities more control over health programs \u2014 often placing USAID in a supporting role.\n\n\u201cUSAID is not footing the bill for the majority of health needs worldwide, but they often support a key part of the system,\u201d said Puzo Smith. \u201cWhen you turn that off overnight, it throws the whole system into disarray.\u201d\n\nUnder a waiver granted by Rubio to the United States\u2019 flagship HIV prevention program, PEPFAR, doctors are free to administer \u201clifesaving HIV care and treatment services,\u201d but some say they are afraid to proceed because U.S.-funded systems to track pharmaceutical supplies are disabled and access to USAID\u2019s global payment system has not been restored.\n\nGlobal security\n\nThe United States spends nearly $10 billion on programs designed to reduce global conflict.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne third of \u201cstabilization\u201d funding was given directly to Israel in 2023, followed by large contributions to Ukraine and Egypt. U.S. support to Israel increased dramatically after the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, and the war in Gaza. Trump issued a waiver for Israel and Egypt that allows U.S. funding to continue throughout the pause.\n\nThe United States also leads efforts to combat violent extremism in Syria, Iraq and across North Africa.\n\nAt Al Hol, a desert camp in northeast Syria that houses thousands of former Islamic State fighters and their families, a collection of U.S. contractors provide food, water and fuel to residents, and train the camp\u2019s security forces.\n\nAlthough some programs have resumed following a State Department waiver, the future of key contractors may be in jeopardy because USAID has not issued payments for other regional programs in December and January, according to Proximity International. The U.S.-based contractor says it is owed more than $2 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe will fail because USAID does not have a working mechanism to pay us back for money we have already spent on allowable expenses,\u201d said Courtney Brown, Proximity International\u2019s CEO.\n\nIn Iraq, the future of a flagship effort to resettle the families of former Islamic State fighters is also in doubt.\n\nThe U.S.-backed program \u201cfacilitated security clearances, cross-border transit and rehabilitation support for the new arrivals,\u201d said a former USAID senior staff member. \u201cNow all of that is on pause.\u201d\n\nThe former staffer fears that the breakdown in U.S. programming will undercut years of local trust-building and strengthen the hand of Tehran.\n\n\u201cA more stable Iraq was a more sovereign Iraq that could stand up to Iranian pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernance\n\nU.S. investments in global governance range from anti-corruption initiatives to programs that help safeguard elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Biden administration committed more than $14 billion to Ukraine to soften the political and economic damage from Russia\u2019s war with the nation. It also poured funding into Eastern European countries, such as Moldova, to counteract Russian influence.\n\nColombia, a key South American ally, is home to one of the most robust governance programs. The country has recently seen an upsurge in fighting between rival rebel groups and is hosting more than 3 million Venezuelan migrants. USAID was leading efforts to integrate new arrivals and reduce the flow of migrants to the north \u2014 a Trump administration priority.\n\n\u201cWe used all the tools of national security: defense, diplomacy and development,\u201d said Susan Reichle, a retired USAID mission director. \u201cYou need all three to help a country, particularly after conflict.\u201d\n\nReichle fears the sudden U.S. departure will create a power vacuum.",

He tries to flick Wood for four on the legside but misses. Wood throws his hands up. In the end is content with a singel \u2013 Wood\u2019s over going for just three runs. England have managed to claw back a little control here. At the half way point, India need another 126 to win. Share\n\n4m ago 14.43 GMT 24th over India 176-2 (Rohit 95, Shreyas 10) The crowd are hungry. Three singles. England bring the field up. A wide from Rashid.

The crowd are hushed with disappointment as Virat shuffles back to the bunker, just a couple of singles off the over. Hello there Brian Withington: \u201cA thought initially prompted by an unsuccessful Nathan Lyon review against Sri Lanka the other day and reinforced by Woods review of Rohit earlier - the umpire\u2019s call margin is too arbitrary and inflexible, being too generous in some situations and too parsimonious in others. For example that Woods delivery would have required after burners to clamber over the stumps rather than pleasingly splash the bails boundarywards. \u201cI think the answer is simple without dispensing entirely with the concept - just use the tracking algorithm to calculate probability of the umpire being in error (I\u2019m sure it already can). And then overturn whenever tracking says the umpire is wrong with say [99]% confidence (precise number set after case study review).\n\n\u201cProjections of trajectory where the ball has travelled a decent distance before hitting the pad (which is also close to the wicket) are inherently more reliable than others. And cricket balls that have reached the apex of their bounce before striking the pad don\u2019t climb any higher \u2026\u201d I\u2019ll throw that one to the floor\u2026 Share\n\n24m ago 14.23 GMT WICKET!

Rohit does up his shoelaces and they take DRINKS. \u201cHi Tanya, lovely way to spend Sunday. Unless you\u2019re an England bowler perhaps. Maybe I\u2019m oversimplifying things but would it be better if we\u2019re not bowling leg side and allowing Rohit and Shubman to just help it to the boundary? This side still feels pretty unbalanced, especially in the spin department. I can\u2019t understand why we only have Rashid as a front line spinner? It seems pretty misguided. Pace, pace and more pace doesn\u2019t work everywhere. Not without some variation.\u201d Hello, Guy Hornsby! I guess they\u2019re hoping for Root and Livingstone\u2019s variations to do some work \u2013 does feels a bit like Rohit could eat them for breakfast though.

The crowd are very enthusiastic though. Rohit pulls another short ball from Atkinson for four, then Kohli drives him with perfect high elbow, straight legs and exquisite positioning straight down the ground for another. \u201cSome fascinating insights to noise at cricket grounds there.\u201d writes Dean Kinsella. \u201cI have travelled in India and have experienced both beautiful music and the treble only speaker systems at festivals. But my point wasn\u2019t only about noise in India only. Its one of the main reasons I would never consider attending an episode of the hundred or a T20 in England or anywhere else. I am a musician myself and love live concerts even loud ones (though more often when I was younger and less fuddy duddy). But I just don\u2019t see the value of four bars of a four minute tune.

Tick, then tock, of singles, India content to keep this tempo up. Hello Nigam Nuggehalli. \u201c Re the message from Dean Kinsella about the DJ and the music, here\u2019s what I wrote in a newspaper column about my experience watching the 2023 World Cup game between India and Australia in Chennai: \u2018We reached Chennai and went to the Chidambaram stadium where we discovered that things were better organised than Bangalore. We were inside the stadium in no time at all. It appeared to us that we had left the chaos of Bangalore behind. We felt that the sauna like effect of Chennai weather puts people in a stupor where any unnecessary activity is restricted naturally. The only exception was the DJ at the stadium, who acted like he was in a universe of his own. \u201cThe DJ\u2019s favourite activity was to egg the crowd on in the middle of every over. Waiting until the end of the over interfered with his world view. If a fielder dived and saved a run or the bowler got a wicket, the DJ had to intervene and bellow that the fielder was brilliant and the bowler was awesome. For the few people who didn\u2019t get it, the DJ gave some pointers and lines for the crowd to chant. I thought I will get some respite between the overs. But the period between play was taken over by music that was so loud I thought it was coming from somewhere inside me. After some time, I was habituated to the drill. I got up and cheered when the DJ told us to and sat down when he took a break. My dear students, I realised that in the post IPL world, almost everything can be converted into entertainment. I thought I had gone to see a cricket game, but I found myself in the middle of a carnival. \u201cEntertainment is not a bad thing. Cricketers claim, certainly with more frequency recently, that they are basically entertainers. But here\u2019s the thing. They are not basically entertainers. They are basically sportsmen. But this idea appears to be lost in contemporary times and not just among sportsmen. Newscasters have also become entertainers. I suppose professors might be next in line. A few years ago I was asked by one of my students to present some videos on Aristotle. I refused. But I have loaded up on some Aristotle videos, just in case the demand for entertainment hots up.\u2019\u201d Thank you Nigam \u2013 fascinating.

Jos Buttler looked in glorious form but when he was out for 34, England produced the collapse that is always in their back pocket, losing their last seven wickets for 85. Nearly half of those runs came from the bat of Liam Livingstone, who, without being at his blistering best, at least made sure that they reached 300. For India, Ravi Jadeja was masterly with three for 35 and Shubman Gill took three catches, two of them outstanding. The ground is small, which suggests 304 is not enough. But the wicket is two-paced, which says the opposite. England have certainly given themselves a chance, but the Indians will know that one big partnership should be enough to seal the series.

      "title": "ICC: Dozens of member states back top criminal court after Trump sanctions",
      "content": "Dozens of countries back International Criminal Court after Trump sanctions\n\n2 days ago Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, White House Amy Walker BBC News\n\nGetty Images Trump previously sanctioned ICC officials during his first term in office in 2020\n\nDozens of countries have expressed \"unwavering support\" for the International Criminal Court (ICC) after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on its staff. A majority of member states, including the UK, Germany and France, said that the ICC was \"a vital pillar of the international justice system\". Trump announced the sanctions after hosting Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - the first foreign leader to visit him since returning to power. Last year, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza - which Israel denies - as well as a Hamas commander. The US has condemned the court's \"shameful moral equivalency\" between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe US and Israel do not recognise the authority of the ICC, the only global court with powers to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It has also previously launched investigations into US citizens. The ICC counts 125 member states around the world, including the UK and many European nations. The UK, France and Germany were among the 79 signatories to a joint statement issued on Friday to condemn Trump's executive order. Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy were among the absent.\n\nReuters\n\nEarlier on Friday, the ICC had called on its member states and global civil society to \"stand united for justice and fundamental human rights.\" It pledged to continue \"providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world\". The ICC last year issued arrest warrants for US-allied Israeli leaders, and a Hamas commander, over the war in Gaza. ICC prosecutors have said there are \"reasonable grounds\" to suggest Netanyahu, his former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas's Mohammed Deif - who was killed last year - bear \"criminal responsibility for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity\". But a White House memo circulated on Thursday accused the ICC of creating a \"shameful moral equivalency\" between Hamas and Israel by issuing the warrants at the same time. Trump's order said the ICC's recent actions \"set a dangerous precedent\" which threatened to \"infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States\". It argued the ICC \"undermines\" the national security and foreign policy work of Washington and its allies. The order also said the US and Israel \"are thriving democracies with militaries that strictly adhere to the laws of war\". The sanctions were announced while Netanyahu was on a visit to Washington. The list of affected individuals has not yet been announced, but the sanctions could target people who work in ICC investigations. Sanctions could include financial and visa restrictions placed on individuals and their families. The court's technical and IT operations - including evidence gathering - could also be affected. Observers have voiced fears that victims of alleged atrocities may hesitate to testify. The court's inaugural chief prosecutor has told the BBC how the rest of the world responds will be most important. \"It's a challenge for the all the state parties - for all Europe, UK, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - are they going to let Mr Trump to become the global president?\" Luis Moreno Ocampo told the BBC Newshour programme. The UN has called for the measure to be reversed, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the ICC \"must be able to freely pursue the fight against global impunity\". But Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he \"strongly\" commended Trump's executive order. He claimed the ICC's actions were \"immoral and have no legal basis\", accusing the court of not operating \"in accordance with international law\".\n\nCan Trump really take ownership of Gaza?\n\nThe US has repeatedly rejected any ICC jurisdiction over American officials or citizens, and has accused the court of placing constraints on Israel's right to self-defence, while ignoring Iran and anti-Israel groups. During his first term in office, Trump imposed sanctions on ICC officials who were investigating whether US forces had committed war crimes in Afghanistan. This included a travel ban and asset freezes against former chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda. Those sanctions were lifted by President Joe Biden's administration. But during his last weeks in office, Biden also criticised the ICC's warrant for Netanyahu, calling the move \"outrageous\" and saying there was no equivalence between Israel and Hamas. In response to efforts to what they described as attempts to challenge the ICC's authority, nine nations - including South Africa and Malaysia - launched the Hague Group last month in an effort to defend the court and its rulings.\n\nTrump's signing of his latest executive order follows his announcement of a plan for the US to \"take over\" Gaza, resettle its Palestinian population and turn the territory into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". After Arab leaders and the UN condemned the idea, the US president restated it on his Truth Social social media platform on Thursday. In recent years, the court has issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, Taliban leaders for \"persecuting Afghan girls and women\" and Myanmar's military leader for crimes against the Rohingya Muslims.",

On Feb. 5, 2025, the Trump administration asks the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to put their international engagement work on hold. Evan Vucci / AP\n\nThe Trump administration has told the federal government\u2019s ocean and atmosphere scientists to stop their international work.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nWord came down verbally in all-staff meetings throughout the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Wednesday: All \u201cinternational engagements\u201d were on hold.\n\nStaff were told to stop having discussions or meetings, real or virtual, on international topics.\n\nThe edict included directions not to email or work with \u201cforeign national colleagues,\u201d according to WIRED, which first reported it.\n\nNOAA employees told KUOW that career officials with the agency struggled to interpret the edict and tell employees which specific activities were prohibited.\n\n\u201c[The agency] is seeking guidance currently on whether or not email exchanges regarding science are included in this,\u201d an internal document obtained by KUOW said.\n\nRelated: Trump picks Neil Jacobs to head NOAA, a scientist with 'Sharpiegate' ties\n\nAll the following \u201cengagements\u201d are on pause indefinitely until political appointees atop the agency can review them, according to an internal NOAA document:\n\n\u2022 International travel or meetings\n\n\u2022 Virtual meetings on international topics\n\n\u2022 Bilateral meetings\n\n\u2022 International working group or expert group meetings\n\n\u2022 International science organization meetings\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\n\u2022 Emails with international organizations discussing policy positions\n\nNOAA, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, has about 12,000 employees, more than half of whom are scientists and engineers, according to the agency\u2019s website.\n\nIts many branches include the National Weather Service, the National and Pacific Tsunami Warning Centers, and NOAA Fisheries, responsible for everything from salmon catches to endangered orcas.\n\nThe agency is also a major hub of climate monitoring and research.

      "content": "In response to the executive order announced today by President Trump imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC), Agn\u00e8s Callamard, Amnesty International\u2019s Secretary General, said:\n\n\u201cThis reckless action sends the message that Israel is above the law and the universal principles of international justice. It suggests that President Trump endorses the Israeli government\u2019s crimes and is embracing impunity.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s executive order is vindictive. It is aggressive. It is a brutal step that seeks to undermine and destroy what the international community has painstakingly constructed over decades, if not centuries: global rules that are applicable to everyone and aim to deliver justice for all. The sanctions constitute another betrayal of our common humanity.\n\n\u201cThe United States is ready to punish an institution that ensures the individuals most responsible for committing atrocities cannot escape justice. No one responsible for crimes under international law should be protected or aided in their attempts to escape individual accountability, least of all with the assistance of the US government based on President Trump\u2019s political alliances.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt an historic moment when we are witnessing a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, and the global rule of law coming under threat from multiple fronts, institutions like the Court are needed more than ever to advance human rights protections, prevent future atrocities and secure justice for victims.\n\nNo one responsible for crimes under international law should be protected or aided in their attempts to escape individual accountability, least of all with the assistance of the US government based on President Trump\u2019s political alliances. Agn\u00e8s Callamard, Amnesty International\u2019s Secretary General\n\n\u201cThis attack against the ICC seeks to damage the Court\u2019s independent pursuit of international justice. The sanctions issued will harm accountability, a crucial ingredient to global and long-term security. They will embolden perpetrators, present and future. They will negatively impact the interests of all victims globally and those who look to the Court for justice in all the countries where it\u2019s conducting investigations, including Darfur, Libya, the Philippines, Palestine, Ukraine and Venezuela.\n\n\u201cThe ICC performs a vital role by investigating crimes under international law, often committed by the most powerful individuals, in situations where \u2013 without its involvement \u2013 the perpetrators would benefit from perpetual impunity. The sanctions are also an affront to 125 member states who have collectively resolved that the Court must be able to effectively pursue justice \u2013 which means it must be able to undertake independent judicial functions, such as issuing arrest warrants, for example, against Benjamin Netanyahu or Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cGovernments around the world and regional organizations must do everything in their power to mitigate and block the effect of President Trump\u2019s sanctions. Through collective and concerted actions, ICC member states can protect the Court and its staff. Urgent action is needed, like never before.\u201d\n\nBackground information:\n\nOn 14 January, Amnesty International, the Coalition for the International Criminal Court and more than 140 of its member NGOs and coalitions from around the world issued a joint statement opposing US efforts to impose sanctions related to the ICC and urging member states to defend the Court, its officials, and those cooperating with it from measures aimed at undermining its vital mandate for justice.",

      "title": "Trump signs an executive order sanctioning the International Criminal Court",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order sanctioning the International Criminal Court, accusing the body of improperly targeting the United States and Israel.\n\nThe order includes both financial sanctions and visa restrictions against unspecified ICC officials and their family members found to have assisted in investigations of U.S. citizens or allies. NBC News previously reported on the contents of the order in a fact sheet it obtained.\n\nLast November, the ICC sparked bipartisan backlash in Washington by issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and several Hamas leaders simultaneously. The Trump administration order claims this created a \u201cshameful moral equivalency.\u201d\n\nThe court said there was reason to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant used \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeting civilians in Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza \u2014 charges Israeli officials dismissed as false and antisemitic.\n\nA spokesperson for the court condemned Trump\u2019s order \u201cseeking to impose sanctions on its officials and harm its independent and impartial judicial work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Court stands firmly by its personnel and pledges to continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world, in all Situations before it,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe call on our 125 States Parties, civil society and all nations of the world to stand united for justice and fundamental human rights.\u201d\n\nThe signing of the executive order Thursday appeared timed to Netanyahu's visit to Washington, which included an Oval Office meeting Tuesday.\n\n\"The ICC\u2019s recent actions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces, by exposing them to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest,\" said the text of the executive order.\n\nIn his first term, Trump argued that the ICC has \u201cno jurisdiction, no legitimacy and no authority\u201d in the U.S., and neither the U.S. nor Israel are parties to the so-called Rome Statute, which established the court.\n\n\u201cThe ICC was designed to be a court of last resort,\u201d the fact sheet on the executive order reads. \u201cBoth the United States and Israel maintain robust judiciary systems and should never be subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the House passed a bill to sanction the ICC that was later blocked by Democrats in the Senate.\n\nNeither Israel nor the U.S. recognizes the jurisdiction of the ICC, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands, and has no police to enforce its warrants. Under the Rome Statute that created it, signatories are obliged to carry out arrest warrants, no matter the rank of the accused. But most governments also abide by the international legal principle that heads of state have legal immunity from other courts.",

      "content": "Amnesty International on Friday expressed deep concern over the recent amendment to Article 248 of El Salvador\u2019s constitution, warning that the change could drastically undermine human rights protections.\n\nAmnesty International Americas director Ana Piquer criticized the new legislative method imposed by the amendment, suggesting it \u201ccould undermine human rights in the future and limit people\u2019s opportunities to participate in public affairs.\u201d The rights organization claimed that this reduction in civic space and public engagement in governmental decisions threatens to sideline necessary public input and consolidate power, risking the erosion of democratic norms and the rule of law.\n\nHistorically, any constitutional changes in El Salvador required approval across two consecutive legislative sessions. This process was designed to be measured and inclusive, allowing ample time for public debate and ensuring a variety of perspectives could influence legislative reforms. On January 29, 2025, however, the Legislative Assembly ratified an amendment to Article 248 of the Constitution of El Salvador and significantly altered this procedure. The law now permits a single legislative body, armed with a three-quarter majority, to enact constitutional changes, potentially leading to rapid ratification of amendments with less time for consideration.\n\nFurthermore, critics argue that the modification of Article 248 could set a precedent for future amendments that might weaken the judicial system and diminish human rights protections. The ruling party\u2019s existing supermajority in the Legislative Assembly, coupled with its history of pushing through significant legal changes with minimal consultation, indicates that this trend is likely to continue under the new procedure.\n\nThe international community, including human rights organizations and political analysts, has echoed Amnesty International\u2019s concerns. There is strong advocacy for the return to a more transparent and participatory constitutional process to safeguard human rights and democracy in El Salvador. This call to action is underscored by ongoing concerns over the country\u2019s adherence to its human rights obligations, especially under recent states of emergency that have further restricted public freedoms and access to justice. Rights advocates argue that these conditions have set a troubling precedent for the implications of the new constitutional amendment.",

As the end of the decade nears, Gatens said commercial companies are beginning to submit their station proposals to NASA.\n\n\u201cWe are in what we are calling phase one of that process right now, where we have a number of agreements with these companies to help them in developing their concepts and providing financial assistance and expertise,\u201d Gatens said. \u201cThen we're getting ready to issue a request for proposals for phase two \u2026 which will be to get actual proposals from companies full and open competition.\u201d\n\nGatens said while the ISS stands as an important symbol to her, the ISS and these future commercial stations fall in line with NASA\u2019s main objectives: exploration, science and research in low-Earth orbit.\n\n\u201cI've worked on the International Space Station my whole career so, yes, it is bittersweet to think about one day deorbiting it, all that it has stood for and all the work \u2026 and science that has been conducted there,\u201d Gatens said. \u201cBut I'm excited about the new platforms and all that they will have to offer, and I'm excited about continuing our work in low-Earth orbit.\u201d\n\nAxiom Space A team guides a section of Axiom's Hab One module to a new area of the manufacturing floor as it is suspended from a crane.\n\nA plan for new stations\n\nAerospace companies are working to develop commercial space stations to replace the ISS.\n\nOne is Axiom Space, but instead of launching a station after the ISS retires, the company plans to launch several modules starting in 2027.\n\nThe modules will help transition low-Earth orbit exploration into a more habitable experience for crewed missions. The first will be attached to the ISS.\n\nGeorge Motter, senior vice president and chief engineer of Axiom Station, said NASA selected Axiom in 2020 as a commercial provider to attach to the ISS with modules.\n\n\u201cWe have habitat modules. We have payload modules. We have modules that will provide storage and power and thermal rejection,\u201d Motter said. \u201cWe\u2019re building the infrastructure for a city in space. We want to be able to provide the ability to continue to grow the space station, start off small, and then keep growing the International Space Station.\u201d\n\nRecently, NASA asked Axiom to reevaluate the modular plan to help accommodate the ISS retirement plans. Motter said this would allow Axiom to start launching hardware in 2027. In addition, Motter said this plan creates a faster and easier transition when Axiom\u2019s modules are ready to undock from the ISS and create the company\u2019s free-flying station.\n\n\u201cWe're going to be sending up the payloads, power and thermal modules, as our first module to the space station,\u201d Motter said. \u201cThis allows us to have a significant capacity to provide science and the ability to save the science from the ISS or transfer payloads, scientific inquiry and scientific projects, and also any hardware that NASA doesn't need anymore.\u201d\n\nMotter said the advantage of modular systems is that they interconnect and have their own guidance systems. In other words, this system is adaptive and can change as needed.\n\n\u201cThe idea here is, as we build the station, we bring up newer and newer modules,\u201d Motter said. \u201cWe may find that there might be a module that we don't need anymore, and it can fly off and dispose of itself safely by reentry into the Pacific Ocean, into Point Nemo as they say. By doing that, we can continually regenerate Axiom station and be able to sort of make it what we need it to be, not only now but in the future.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2025 Central Florida Public Media",

      "title": "Team USA Wins Three Medals at U.S. Synchronized Skating International Classic",
      "content": "By Kristen Henneman\n\nTeam USA won three medals Saturday at the 2025 U.S. Synchronized Skating International Classic in Norwood, Massachusetts.\n\nSkating on home soil at the first ISU Challenger Series Synchronized Skating event held in the United States since 2019 and the final Challenger Series event of the season, the Haydenettes earned bronze in the senior event, their second medal in the series this season.\n\nIn the junior event, two U.S. teams stood on the podium as Teams Elite clinched gold and Skyliners junior secured bronze. The podium finish is the first in the Challenger Series for Skyliners junior this season and their sixth medal in the series overall. For Teams Elite, who has the most Challenger Series medals of any U.S. team with eight, the gold is their second of the season. They are undefeated in the series in the last two seasons.\n\nSkating at the club they represent, The Skating Club of Boston, the Haydenettes used international season\u2019s best scores for their short program, free skate and overall score to claim the bronze.\n\nThe second team to take the ice, the 31-time U.S. champions and reigning World silver medalists came out strong in front of a home crowd, garnering 9.10 points for their Level 4 move element and 10.35 points for their intersection with a Level 4 point of intersection \u2013 the second-highest scoring element of the segment. Both skills were awarded grades of execution of 2.60 and 2.85, respectively.\n\nOverall, the Haydenettes earned Level 4 designations on four of their elements during their performance to \u201cLim Fantasy of Companionship for Piano and Orchestra\" by Barua Joi, Martin Manuel Denis and Cody Fry, finishing third with 76.78 points.\n\nSkating to \"Caves\" by Cody Fry and \"Eleanor Rigby\" by Joshua Bell and Frankie Moreno in the free skate, the Haydenettes claimed Level 4 marks on four elements. Highlights included their Level 4 pair, move and twizzle elements, which all received more than eight points. They totaled 141.99 points in the segment for a total score of 218.77.\n\nThe medal marks the sixth total Challenger Series medal for the Haydenettes since the series\u2019 inception in 2019.\n\n\u201cI think we feel really good,\u201d said Autumn Coulthard, who is skating on the Haydenettes for the sixth year. \u201cWe feel really united, really together. I think [Head Coach Saga Krantz] said it perfectly. We were calm, we were emotional, we really felt the music and that crowd out there, we just had a lot of fun and just tried to soak in every moment because it's not every day that you get a home competition.\"\n\nThe Skyliners and Miami University also skated for Team USA in the senior competition, finishing sixth and seventh, respectively.\n\nThe Skyliners received 59.79 points in the short program and 122.79 points in the free skate for a two-day total of 182.58 points.\n\nMiami University claimed 172.52 points overall. They tallied 56.13 points in the short program before earning 116.39 points in the free skate.\n\nThe United States secured three of the top four spots in the junior competition.\n\nTeams Elite took first place in both segments to bring home the gold.\n\nIn the short program, the 2024 U.S. champions totaled the highest element and component scores. Their skate to \u201cLacrimosa\" received Level 4 marks on all five elements \u2013 the only junior team to do so in the short program.\n\nTeams Elite came out with their two strongest elements, a Level 4 pivoting block worth 8.97 points and a Level 4 intersection with a Level 4 point of intersection that was awarded 9.90 points. Despite a fall on their twizzle element, the team from Northbrook, Illinois, still finished first with 72.58 points.\n\nIn the free skate, Teams Elite scored 129.16 to bring their total score to 201.74, which topped the standings by nearly nine points over Les Supremes, last year\u2019s World Junior champions.\n\nTheir performance to music from Black Swan achieved Level 4s on five elements. They were the only team to score more than 10 points on any element, and did it twice on both of their intersections, which generated 10.35 and 10.05 points.\n\n\u201cIt feels amazing,\u201d said Quinn McCormick \u2013 who has been on Teams Elite for seven years \u2013 of the gold medal. \u201cI'm very proud of my team and all the hard work that we've accomplished this week and this season.\u201d\n\nPerforming to \u201cNessun Dorma\" by The Tenors in the short program, Skyliners junior \u2013 the reigning World junior bronze medalists \u2013 attained Level 4 marks on three elements as well as grades of execution of 1.28 or better on each of their elements. Their Level 4 intersection with a Level 4 point of intersection claimed 9.75 points as they finished the segment in third with 69.93 points.\n\nSkyliners junior maintained their podium position in the free skate with 118.31 points, which is less than a point under their season\u2019s best international score. Their northern lights-themed program was awarded Level 4s on five elements and tallied the second-highest program component score of the event with 65.95 points. They ended the event with 188.24 points overall.\n\n\u201cObviously we had a lot of our U.S. fans here, so it was great to feel the energy from our fans and hear all the cheering throughout each of the elements,\u201d said Isabelle Gao, a longtime member of the Skyliners organization. \u201cIt was really special.\u201d\n\nFinishing just off the podium, the Lexettes clinched their best result in the Challenger Series this season with fourth.\n\nSkating on their home club ice at The Skating Club of Boston, The Lexettes gave their best short program performance of the season, totaling 68.71 points for a new international season\u2019s best.\n\nTheir skate to music from The Mask of Zorro started with a Level 4 intersection with a Level 4 point of intersection for 9.60 points. The home team also earned a Level 4 mark on their twizzle element.\n\nIn the free skate, the Lexettes secured the third-highest total element score of the segment for their performance to \"What Was I Made For?\" by Billie Eilish. Tallying 116.04 points for a two-day total of 184.75, the Lexettes were awarded Level 4s on four elements \u2013 both their intersections, which also had a Level 4 point of intersection, as well as their traveling element and move element.\n\nTeam Image ended the competition in sixth place, scoring 57.96 points in the short program and 105.60 points in the free skate. They finished with a final mark of 163.56 points.\n\nFor full results at the U.S. Synchronized Skating International Classic, visit the 2025 Challenger Series Competition Central.",

      "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best FMCG Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stands against other best FMCG stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nConsumer Staples Outlook For 2025\n\nConsumer staples refer to essential daily-use products such as packaged food, toothpaste, and dish detergent. These products often run out quickly off the supermarket shelves and are considered \u201cdefensive\u201d because consumers continue to purchase these necessities even during economic downturns. Moreover, consumer staple companies are mostly mature dividend payers.\n\nOn December 10, 2024, Ben Shuleva, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager shared his outlook for the sector in a report published on Fidelity Investments. The consumer staples sector had a positive year but lagged behind the broader market due to investors favoring higher-growth stocks. The high interest rates and concerns about GLP-1 weight-loss drugs affecting food consumption also impacted performance negatively. However, despite these challenges, the sector still posted strong absolute gains. Compared to the S&P 500 index the consumer staple sector gained 16.7% on a year-to-date basis as of December 9, whereas the S&P 500 index gained 26.9% during the same time.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks to Buy Right Now and 10 High Growth Financial Stocks To Invest In.\n\nBen Shuleva from Fidelity Investments anticipates a return to normalcy for the consumer staples sector in 2025. He suggests this based on a broadly stable economic environment with healthy employment and steady real wage growth. In addition, the Fed is expected to begin cutting interest rates, which could boost dividend-paying stocks. Lastly, consumer spending has remained strong and is expected to remain resilient in 2025, thereby indicating positive sales growth for the sector. Shuleva anticipates that these factors will lead the sector to outperform the broader market in 2025. However, there could be a few uncertainties that could hamper the growth trajectory. The new presidential administration may introduce changes in tariff policies, which could affect certain consumer staples products. Although most consumer staples are manufactured domestically, so the direct impact of tariffs might be limited. Moreover, a strengthening US dollar can negatively affect consumer staples companies with international operations by reducing their foreign earnings when converted back into dollars. Shuleva emphasizes focusing on core fundamentals when investing in consumer staple companies, such as those operating in favorable market structures and maintaining strong underlying growth profiles.\n\nStory Continues",

      "content": "\u25b6 Follow today\u2019s live updates on the Trump administration\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court over investigations of Israel, a close U.S. ally.\n\nNeither the U.S. nor Israel is a member of or recognizes the court, which has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes over his military response in Gaza after the Hamas attack against Israel in October 2023. Tens of thousands of Palestinians, including children, have been killed during the Israeli military\u2019s response.\n\nThe order Trump signed Thursday accuses the ICC of engaging in \u201cillegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel\u201d and of abusing its power by issuing \u201cbaseless arrest warrants\u201d against Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant.\n\n\u201cThe ICC has no jurisdiction over the United States or Israel,\u201d the order states, adding that the court had set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d with its actions against both countries.\n\nTrump\u2019s action came as Netanyahu was visiting Washington. He and Trump held talks Tuesday at the White House, and Netanyahu spent some of Thursday meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe order says the U.S. will impose \u201ctangible and significant consequences\u201d on those responsible for the ICC\u2019s \u201ctransgressions.\u201d Actions may include blocking property and assets and not allowing ICC officials, employees and relatives to enter the United States.\n\nHuman rights activists said sanctioning court officials would have a chilling effect and run counter to U.S. interests in other conflict zones where the court is investigating.\n\n\u201cVictims of human rights abuses around the world turn to the International Criminal Court when they have nowhere else to go, and President Trump\u2019s executive order will make it harder for them to find justice,\u201d said Charlie Hogle, staff attorney with American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s National Security Project. \u201cThe order also raises serious First Amendment concerns because it puts people in the United States at risk of harsh penalties for helping the court identify and investigate atrocities committed anywhere, by anyone.\u201d\n\nHogle said the order \u201cis an attack on both accountability and free speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can disagree with the court and the way it operates, but this is beyond the pale,\u201d Sarah Yager, Washington director of Human Rights Watch, said in an interview prior to the announcement.\n\nLike Israel, the U.S. is not among the court\u2019s 124 members and has long harbored suspicions that a global court could arbitrarily prosecute U.S. officials. A 2002 law authorizes the Pentagon to liberate any American or U.S. ally held by the court. In 2020, Trump sanctioned chief prosecutor Karim Khan\u2019s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, over her decision to open an inquiry into war crimes committed by all sides, including the U.S., in Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, those sanctions were lifted under President Joe Biden, and the U.S. began to tepidly cooperate with the tribunal \u2014 especially after Khan in 2023 charged Russian President Vladimir Putin with war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nDriving that turnaround was Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who organized meetings in Washington, New York and Europe between Khan and GOP lawmakers who have been among the court\u2019s fiercest critics.\n\nNow, Graham says he feels betrayed by Khan \u2014 and is vowing to crush the court as well as the economy of any country that tries to enforce the arrest warrant against Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cThis is a rogue court. This is a kangaroo court,\u201d Graham said in an interview in December. \u201cThere are places where the court makes perfect sense. Russia is a failed state. People fall out of windows. But I never in my wildest dreams imagined they would go after Israel, which has one of the most independent legal systems on the planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe legal theory they\u2019re using against Israel has no limits and we\u2019re next,\u201d he added.\n\nBiden had called the warrants an abomination, and Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, has accused the court of having an antisemitic bias.\n\nAny sanctions could cripple the court by making it harder for its investigators to travel and by compromising U.S.-developed technology to safeguard evidence. The court last year suffered a major cyberattack that left employees unable to access files for weeks.\n\nSome European countries are pushing back. The Netherlands, in a statement late last year, called on other ICC members \u201cto cooperate to mitigate risks of these possible sanctions, so that the court can continue to carry out its work and fulfil its mandate.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. relationship with the ICC is a complicated one. The United States participated in negotiations that led to the adoption of the Rome Statute that established the court as a tribunal of last resort to prosecute the world\u2019s worst atrocities \u2014 war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide \u2014 if individual governments did not take action.\n\nThe U.S. voted against the Rome Statute in 1998. Then-U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the statute in 2000 but did not send the treaty to the U.S. Senate to be ratified.\n\nWhen George W. Bush became president in 2001, he effectively canceled the U.S. signature and led a campaign to pressure countries to enter bilateral agreements not to hand over Americans to the ICC.\n\n___\n\nGoodman reported from Miami.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other best stocks to invest in according to AI.\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence in finance has led many investors to question whether AI-powered tools like ChatGPT can effectively pick stocks. While ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) can process vast amounts of financial data, market news, and historical trends, their ability to consistently outperform human experts or quantitative models remains debatable. Instead, investors should look towards AI-driven hedge funds, such as Renaissance Technologies and Two Sigma, that have historically outperformed the market using machine learning models. For example, the Medallion Fund of the former achieved an annualized return of 66% before fees from 1988 to 2018. These funds rely on proprietary algorithms, high-frequency trading, and massive datasets.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nOne indicator of hedge funds being ahead of the curve when it comes to stocks and the broader market in general is a recent Goldman Sachs note to investors which details that top hedge funds navigated the recent tech selloff without significant losses, even managing to post nominal gains since the turn of the year despite a big dropoff in the market amid concerns over trade tariffs and an AI bubble. Per a report by news agency Reuters, US President Trump has delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico by one month, fueling wild swings in currency, bond and share markets. Despite the turmoil, stock-picking hedge funds that take bets based on company fundamentals recorded an average 2.6% return, their best month since February 2024, given a broader market rally, the report claimed.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nThe stocks listed below were mentioned in articles by prominent finance publications as some of the best ChatGPT stock picks over the past six months.

      "content": "Click to expand Image The International Criminal Court (ICC) is seen in The Hague, Netherlands, November 7, 2019. \u00a9 2019 AP Photo/Peter Dejong, File\n\n(Washington, DC) \u2013 US government sanctions targeting the International Criminal Court (ICC) would undermine international accountability for the worst crimes and deprive victims around the globe of justice, Human Rights Watch said today. US President Donald Trump issued an executive order on February 6, 2025, that authorizes asset freezes and entry bans on ICC officials and others supporting the court\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s executive order on the International Criminal Court effectively puts the United States on the side of war criminals at the expense of victims of grave crimes seeking justice,\u201d said Liz Evenson, international justice director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cICC member countries should publicly and forcefully support the court for doing the job it was set up to do: ensuring no one is above the law.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order, issued during the week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington, DC, makes clear that his administration seeks to shield US and Israeli officials from facing war crimes and crimes against humanity charges before the ICC. ICC judges issued warrants of arrest for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in November 2024.\n\nThe ICC judges found reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip beginning, at least, on October 8, 2023, including the starvation of civilians, intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population, murder, and persecution.\n\nThe judges also issued an arrest warrant for Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (known as Mohammed Deif), commander-in-chief of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019 military wing. The Qassam Brigades announced on January 30 that Deif had been killed during the hostilities.\n\nThe ICC is the permanent international court created to try people, including senior officials, accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression. Currently, 125 countries, nearly two-thirds of United Nations members, have joined the court.\n\nThe ICC is a court of last resort, stepping in when national authorities are unable or unwilling to conduct genuine proceedings. In addition to its Palestine investigation, the court has opened investigations into alleged atrocities in 16 situations, including in Darfur, Sudan, Bangladesh/Myanmar, Ukraine, and Venezuela.\n\nThe February 6 executive order authorizes sanctions against non-US persons who assist in investigations to which the US administration objects. It provides for asset freezes and entry bans against \u201cthe person listed in the Annex to this order.\u201d The annex has not been made public. The order also provides for asset freezes and entry bans against \u201cany foreign person\u2026directly engag[ing] or otherwise aid[ing] any effort by the International Criminal Court to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute\u201d a \u201cprotected person,\u201d defined as any US person or any citizen or lawful resident of US allies that are not ICC member countries or have not consented to the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction over that person.\n\nSanctions can also be applied to others supporting the ICC\u2019s investigations, while entry bans can be applied to family members of those sanctioned and to other ICC staff. The executive order requires the US treasury secretary, after consultation with the secretary of state, to submit to the president a report on additional persons to be sanctioned within 60 days.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed legislation on January 9, 2025, to allow sanctions targeting the ICC, but on January 28, 2025the Senate, voted against moving the bill forward.\n\nIn 2020, during his first term President Trump imposed sanctions on then-ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and another senior court official following Bensouda\u2019s decision to request authorization to open an investigation into the situation in Afghanistan, which included potential cases against US nationals. Many governments criticized the sanctions, which were challenged in twolawsuits in US federal court. The Biden administration rescinded the sanctions. There are no pending ICC cases against US nationals.\n\nUS sanctions have serious effects on those targeted, who lose access to their assets in the United States and are denied commercial and financial dealings with \u201cUS persons,\u201d including banks and other companies. US sanctions also have a chilling effect on non-US banks and other companies outside of US jurisdiction that could themselves lose access to the US banking system if they do not support the sanctions. US persons face penalties, including fines and imprisonment, for violating sanctions.\n\nThe order appears designed not only to intimidate court officials and staff involved in the court\u2019s critical investigations, but also to chill broader cooperation with the ICC, affecting the rights of victims globally, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nUS sanctions are adding to other efforts to undermine international justice, Human Rights Watch said. On May 1, 2024, Netanyahu called on governments to prevent the court from issuing warrants. The Israeli parliament is currently considering a bill aimed at shielding Israeli officials from the ICC investigations by \u201cprohibiting all formal cooperation\u201d between Israeli authorities and the ICC and punishing individuals who assist the court.\n\nAfter US senators in April 2024 threatened the ICC prosecutor with sanctions, the prosecutor\u2019s office called for all attempts \u201cto impede, intimidate or improperly influence\u201d the office to cease immediately. Russian authorities have criminalized cooperation with the ICC and issued arrest warrants against ICC judges and the court\u2019s prosecutor in retaliation for the court\u2019s arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin for the alleged unlawful transfer and deportation of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia.\n\nWhile the US is not an ICC member, the sanctions reverse growing support for the court among US officials in recent years. Following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Republican and Democratic elected officials lauded the court\u2019s efforts to address alleged war crimes in Ukraine by Russian forces, and the US Congress acted to authorize US cooperation with the court\u2019s Ukraine investigation.\n\nAs the threat of US sanctions loomed, ICC member countries, the leadership body of the court\u2019s Assembly of States Parties, the European Union, UN experts, and civil society organizations have spoken out against efforts to obstruct the court\u2019s work.\n\nICC member countries should reaffirm their commitment to defend the court, its officials, and those cooperating with it from any political interference and pressure, Human Rights Watch said. They should also put in place measures to protect the court\u2019s essential work from sanctions, including by enacting blocking statutes and other similar measures. The European Union should promptly impose its blocking statute to mitigate the effects of US sanctions.\n\n\u201cUS sanctions could have a wide-ranging impact on the ICC\u2019s work, undermining every situation on its docket,\u201d Evenson said. \u201cICC member countries should demonstrate that they will ensure that the ICC continues to deliver justice for the worst crimes, whoever is responsible.\u201d",

As strong supporters of the ICC, we regret any attempts to undermine the Court\u2019s independence, integrity and impartiality.\u201d\n\nWhile the US has long pitched itself as the guarantor of an international order that promotes human rights and the rule of law, it has frequently attacked efforts by international bodies to probe alleged abuses by the US and its allies.\n\nIn the executive order imposing sanctions, the Trump administration said that it would bring \u201ctangible and significant consequences\u201d for \u201cillegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel\u201d.\n\nWhile Trump is the first US president to sanction the ICC, his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden also considered the use of sanctions to penalise the court for investigating Israel.\n\nIn November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza, where Israel has carried out a scorched earth campaign that has killed thousands, levelled entire neighbourhoods, displaced millions of people, and included the widespread denial of humanitarian aid.\n\nAt least 61,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks, most of them women and children, a figure that is expected to rise considerably as rescue workers search through the rubble for undiscovered bodies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ICC also issued arrest warrants for leaders of the Palestinian armed group Hamas for alleged war crimes committed during an attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s International Criminal Court sanctions put the US on the side of war criminals at expense of victims,\u201d Omar Shakir, Israel-Palestine director at Human Rights Watch said. \u201cSanctions are for perpetrators \u2013 not those working to hold them to account. States should defend the ICC for doing its job: ensuring no one is above the law.\u201d\n\nDutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said his country would seek to ensure the ICC, based in The Hague, could continue to operate despite announced US sanctions.\n\n\u201cOf course, as the host country, we have a responsibility to guarantee the unhindered functioning of the criminal court at all times. And we will keep doing that,\u201d Schoof told reporters, describing the move as a \u201cdisturbing signal and very regrettable\u201d with potentially \u201csignificant implications\u201d for the ICC\u2019s independence and ongoing investigations.\n\n\u201cThe Netherlands stands by the International Criminal Court. We will continue to support it. We are the host country. We are also proud of the Netherlands and also of The Hague as a city for peace and justice. The ICC is an explicit part of that. And we will do everything we can to ensure that the ICC can fulfil its tasks.\u201d",

      "content": "Russia, South Korea, China, Malaysia, and India Lead International Arrivals as Pattaya Welcomes Over 28 Million Tourists in 2024, Driving Growth and Sustainability Efforts\n\nPattaya continues to establish itself as one of Thailand\u2019s most sought-after destinations, witnessing a remarkable surge in international visitor arrivals. Recent tourism data highlights that Chonburi province\u2014including Pattaya\u2014secured the position as the second most visited location in Thailand by foreign tourists in 2024, second only to Bangkok.\n\nIn 2024, Pattaya attracted an impressive 28,156,302 international tourists, playing a pivotal role in Thailand\u2019s overall tourism growth. This sharp increase from the previous year is a testament to the city\u2019s continuous investment in infrastructure, event promotion, and beach enhancements, all of which contribute to its thriving hospitality sector.\n\nTop Five International Markets Driving Pattaya\u2019s Tourism Boom\n\nChina \u2013 Chinese travelers remain the largest segment of international visitors, fueled by enhanced air connectivity and targeted tourism campaigns. Malaysia \u2013 With its close proximity and easy travel options, Malaysia continues to be a vital source of visitors. Russia \u2013 A long-time favorite among Russian tourists, Pattaya remains a preferred getaway, especially during winter. South Korea \u2013 The city\u2019s vibrant entertainment, scenic beaches, and cultural experiences have cemented South Korea as a key market. India \u2013 Indian travelers are emerging as a major contributor, particularly in nightlife, wedding tourism, and family vacations.\n\nAddressing Tourism Challenges in Pattaya\n\nPattaya\u2019s increasing popularity among Indian tourists has brought both economic benefits and unique challenges. Reports of Indian visitors sleeping on public beaches have drawn attention, sparking discussions on maintaining cleanliness and managing public spaces effectively. While Indian tourists significantly contribute to local businesses, their use of beaches as overnight resting areas has raised concerns among both residents and other visitors. Issues such as overcrowding and maintaining a clean environment have prompted local authorities to explore solutions that balance visitor comfort with sustainable tourism management.\n\nEfforts are underway to enhance beach regulations, promote public awareness regarding local norms, and introduce designated rest areas to prevent misuse of popular seaside locations. These measures aim to ensure a harmonious experience for all visitors while preserving Pattaya\u2019s reputation as a premier destination.\n\nTourism Growth and Economic Impact\n\nThailand welcomed 3.70 million foreign visitors between January 1\u201331, 2025, marking a 19.46% increase compared to the same period in 2024. This surge has translated into a 31.96% rise in tourism revenue, contributing 1.82 trillion baht to the country\u2019s economy.\n\nPattaya\u2019s continued growth is fueled by its diverse attractions, high-profile events, and ongoing investments in the tourism sector. With strong international demand and strategic developments, the city is well-positioned for another year of expansion. As visitor numbers rise, effective management of public spaces and infrastructure will be essential in ensuring that Pattaya maintains its appeal as a top-tier travel destination.\n\nShare On:",

      "content": "Despite the disorientation Hollywood is experiencing, the show must and should go on. Awards season is a vital part of the industry\u2019s economic ecosystem, as strange as that may sound, encompassing months of special screenings, lunches, and advertising campaigns.

This year\u2019s telecast on March 2, to be hosted by Conan O\u2019Brien, promises to be a more modest affair than usual, thanks to the wildfires that devastated large swathes of Los Angeles. (O\u2019Brien himself was evacuated from his residence in the Pacific Palisades; his home was spared, though that was not the case for former Oscars host Billy Crystal, and plenty of other celebrities.)\n\nDespite the disorientation Hollywood is experiencing, the show must and should go on.

With the biz still bruised from COVID shutdowns and the Writers Guild and Screen Actors Guild strikes, canceling this year\u2019s show was never a real consideration.\n\nWhile the cultural impact of the Oscars\u2014or cinema in general\u2014isn\u2019t what it used to be (my TikTok-captivated niece almost never watches movies because they are \u201ctoo long\u201d), for many cinephiles, an Academy Award nomination is a blessing, as it often means more esoteric titles will get a wider push in theaters, or make a quicker appearance on a commonly available streaming service. This is particularly felt in the Best International Feature Film category, where a nomination isn\u2019t just a source of pride for the producing nation, but a chance for the work to be seen in the United States beyond one or two screens in New York City.\n\nThis year\u2019s selection is eclectic, and if these five films have any connection, it\u2019s that they all have female protagonists. (Well, the gender of the cat in Flow is unknown, but the director said he wants audiences to \u201csee their own cat within this character,\u201d and since my cat is a girl, I\u2019m sticking with this!) The other notable thing is that two of the films in this category are also nominated for Best Picture. That\u2019s a first, though the number of Best Picture nominees expanded from five to 10 in 2009, offering a little more room. Here\u2019s a closer look at what\u2019s been nominated.\n\nEmilia P\u00e9rez\n\ndirected by Jacques Audiard\n\nZoe Salda\u00f1a (foreground) and Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n in Emilia P\u00e9rez. Watch the trailer in some markets here.\n\nThe nominee almost guaranteed to win this year is Emilia P\u00e9rez, which has delighted and infuriated filmgoers since its debut at the Cannes Film Festival last summer, and which is currently streaming on Netflix. Though set in Mexico (with dialogue mostly in Spanish), it is a French production from director Jacques Audiard, and two of the three main performers, Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez, are Hollywood stars. The lead, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n (originally from Spain, but she has worked in Mexico for many years), is the first trans woman to win Best Actress at Cannes and is also the first openly trans person to be nominated for a performing Oscar. (Elliot Page was nominated prior to his transition.) She had a decent shot at winning the Oscar, too, until it was recently discovered that her X/Twitter account was rife what could best be called \u201cproblematic remarks,\u201d offering some surprising opinions on Muslims, George Floyd, and even Adolf Hitler. She has since deleted her account. This PR hiccup will probably not affect the movie\u2019s chances, only hers.\n\nIn the film, which has the extravagant flavor of a Mexican telenovela or an Italian opera, Gasc\u00f3n plays a male drug lord, Juan, who hires Salda\u00f1a, an underappreciated lawyer, to facilitate a gender reassignment surgery. At first you think this is someone looking for a foolproof way to masquerade their identity, but we soon see the desire is real. Juan\u2019s death is faked and she becomes Emilia and leaves her wife (Gomez) and children. Then the story turns into a Mrs. Doubtfire-like screwball scenario, with Emilia posing as Juan\u2019s cousin, and living with the family to be near the kids. Oh, and it\u2019s a musical.\n\nFew could accuse Emilia P\u00e9rez of not being a big swing, but a great number of trans critics have condemned the film. GLAAD called it a \u201cprofoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman,\u201d and others have decried the use of what are perceived to be clich\u00e9s, like a trans woman being a killer; a trans person abandoning their family after transition; treating trans identity as a nefarious secret; and describing a trans woman being \u201chalf man, half female.\u201d (This last one is done through song.) It has also been the source of mockery and memes (over 9 million views on this initiating tweet) among very tuned-in online cinephiles.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s a lock for the award. It leads this year\u2019s Oscars with the most nominations at 13, including Best Picture. (Salda\u00f1a is likely to win Best Supporting Actress.) The film has had a huge promotional push from Netflix, which purchased the film\u2019s North American and British rights after Cannes in a bidding war. Though trans critics may be crying foul, mainstream Hollywood liberal types will consider this film, which is sympathetic to trans people in its own way, to be progressive. This is reminiscent of how many Black critics characterized the Civil Rights-era film Green Book reactionary, yet it still won Best Picture in 2019.\n\nI\u2019m Still Here\n\ndirected by Walter Salles\n\nThe nominee with the best chance of upsetting Emilia Per\u00e9z is I\u2019m Still Here, from Brazilian director Walter Salles, a director who sometimes works in Hollywood. His best known previous film is The Motorcycle Diaries, a portrait of young Che Guevara. I\u2019m Still Here, based on a true story, is mostly set in the early 1970s, during Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. Fernanda Torres stars as Eunice Paiva, mother of five children and wife to Ruben Paiva, an ex-politician who was brought in for questioning one day by police and was never heard from again.\n\nWhat makes this movie so special is its frog-in-a-boiling-pot approach. The first 20 minutes barely have any plot at all\u2014we\u2019re just with this fantastic, boisterous family in their lively house by the beach, watching them play foosball, listen to records, and pal around with a new puppy. Over time, though, we realize that there are too many intellectuals and booksellers hanging around to avoid the ire of a hard-right regime. Torres is mesmerizing in the central role, desperately trying to keep her family together, while searching for information about her husband. The final confirmation, years in the making, is an avalanche of mixed emotions. Despite an attempt by current right-wing elements to boycott the movie, it has been a financial success in Brazil.\n\nLike Gasc\u00f3n, Torres is also nominated for Best Actress, and I\u2019m Still Here is also nominated for Best Picture. It is not yet on a streaming platform, but is currently in theaters.\n\nThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\n\ndirected by Mohammad Rasoulof\n\nThe nominee whose behind-the-scenes story has the best chance to become a movie of its own one day is The Seed of the Sacred Fig. The film, a German production in Farsi, comes from Iranian writer-director Mohammad Rasoulof. Like several other Iranian filmmakers, he has been subjected to censorship and arrest in the past, and as Sacred Fig was announced as part of 2024\u2019s main competition in Cannes, he was sentenced to be flogged, imprisoned for eight years, and to have his property confiscated. He fled\u2014initially on foot\u2014to Germany, where he remains. (He still made it to the French Riviera to walk the festival\u2019s red carpet and receive a special jury prize.)\n\nWhy such a fuss? Well, the movie is sympathetic to the \u201c Woman, Life, Freedom \u201d protesters, with our main characters offering sanctuary to a student wanted for questioning after getting her head bashed in. It also takes a jaundiced view of the legal system. Indeed, the story\u2019s paterfamilias is a mid-level bureaucrat given a nice promotion but expected to rubber stamp guilty verdicts. Despite his position, he is unaware of the revolution happening in his own home.\n\nWhile this is certainly very serious material\u2014and the actresses took great personal risk to perform without wearing a hijab, which is against the law even for movie scenes set in a person\u2019s home\u2014the film is also extremely entertaining, with the last act essentially turning into an action picture. The film is not yet streaming but is playing in theaters in select cities.\n\nThe Girl with the Needle,\n\ndirected by Magnus von Horn\n\nThe nominee most likely to invade your subconscious and disturb you with disquieting dreams is The Girl with the Needle, a movie that only grows more horrifying when you learn it is based on a true story. A Danish production from Swedish-born director Magnus von Horn, a graduate of Poland\u2019s highly regarded \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Film School, this eerie, otherworldly black and white drama is a spin on one of Denmark\u2019s most notorious true crime stories.\n\nIf you are Danish, you already know all about Dagmar Overbye, but if you come into this movie as I did, you\u2019ll get to experience a moment of \u201coh my God, what is actually happening here?!\u201d shock, so I\u2019ll keep things vague. Overbye is not the titular girl with the needle, that is Karoline (Vic Carmen Sonne), an impoverished World War I widow (or so she thinks) who begins what she believes is a life-saving affair with the head of the textile factory where she works. An unexpected pregnancy changes that, as does the return of her husband, who is disfigured from combat. (He\u2019ll soon end up as part of an Elephant Man-esque freak show.) Karoline finds salvation, she believes, with a candy store owner who helps women find new homes for unwanted infants, but by this point in the story you\u2019ve seen enough red flags raised to know something\u2019s not right.\n\nIn addition to a remarkable tone, drenched in ominous sound design and high contrast cinematography, the film is daring in having a not particularly likeable lead character take a very slow walk toward redemption. This is a terrific movie with some very gruesome moments. It is currently streaming for subscribers on MUBI and available for digital purchase on other platforms like Amazon.\n\nFlow\n\ndirected by Gints Zilbalodis\n\nThe nominee that you can (and should) watch with your small child is Flow, a surprise inclusion in the Best International Feature Film category that is also nominated for Best Animated Feature. It is a story about a cat who befriends a dog, a capybara, a lemur, and a whale during a troubling time of environmental unease. It has a microscopic budget, features no dialogue, and was made with an open-source animation program. Its director, Gints Zilbalodis, also recorded the original score, though he does not know how to read music or play any instruments. Everything about this movie is a miracle.\n\nFlow is the first Latvian movie to achieve this broad level of acclaim, though it\u2019s worth noting that one of the architects of early cinema, Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein, was Latvian. Eisenstein was revolutionary with creating emotion through editing, and Zilbalodis transforms what at first looks like cheapo computer animation into a marvelous expressiveness\u2014mixing realistic animal behavior with periodic enhancements for dramatic effect. Though the film is resistant to explaining its world, it is clearly an ecologically minded tale, warning of impending floods and the need for disparate personalities to work together if they are to survive. It\u2019s quite likely that the recent Los Angeles catastrophe aided the film in getting its two nominations. Flow is currently in theaters and also available for digital rental or purchase on platforms like Amazon.",

      "title": "International Oscar Film Nominees Reflect on Political Turmoil: \u2018It Just Proves That Maybe There Is No Real Recipe for What Works in Cinema\u2019",
      "content": "This year\u2019s slate of best international film Oscar nominees puts France, Brazil, Germany, Latvia and Denmark center stage for the upcoming Academy Awards. And with several of these films dealing with deep-rooted issues in their country from past to present, ranging from stories about censorship, military takeovers to ultimate redemption and hope in the face of senseless violence, there\u2019s a lot connecting these selections despite their widely differing styles. And in the case of one animated film, an entirely different medium.\n\n\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d which led the overall nomination tally with 13, including best picture and best director, has the most cross-genre appeal, with the film bringing together the movie musical and crime thriller. Director Jacques Audiard previously told Variety that \u201cit\u2019s a film that\u2019s \u2018political,\u2019 I know it. [It\u2019s] as much about trans identity as about the disappeared in Mexico.\u201d\n\nWith its searing black-and-white cinematography, Denmark\u2019s \u201cThe Girl with the Needle,\u201d set in post-WWI Copenhagen, stands out as a particularly dark and disturbing film in the Oscar lineup with its inspiration taken from the Danish serial killer Dagmar Overbye, who died in 1929. Director Magnus von Horn found himself surprised by the Academy recognition, as well as the film\u2019s box office success back in Denmark.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a film you expect to have such reach, especially \u2026 because small children are being subjected to bad things in it,\u201d von Horn says. \u201cIt was a difficult film to get made and financed. So when we saw that it got nominated by the Oscars and had found a home with cinemagoers, it just proves that maybe there is no real recipe for what works in cinema. It\u2019s just good storytelling.\u201d\n\nWith the increasing diversity and international appeal of the Academy\u2019s voting body, von Horn, like other directors whose film travel the world, tuned into his film\u2019s universal appeal across language barriers. Since the Cannes premiere of \u201cThe Girl With the Needle\u201d \u2014 the same festival that launched \u201cFlow,\u201d \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d and \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d \u2014 von Horn has noticed different takeaways from the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cIn South Korea, for example, we spoke about national traumas of illegal adoptions for kids who were stolen in the \u201970s and \u201980s and adopted by families in Sweden and Denmark,\u201d von Horn explains. \u201cOften what it connects to is the story of unwanted people and unwanted children and what we as a society do with them. I think that\u2019s timeless.\u201d\n\nVon Horn also recognizes how the film has resonated for its exploration of horrors for women as the young factory worker, Karoline (Vic Carmen Sonne), struggles to find a legal and safe way to have an abortion. \u201cI live in Poland, which has some of the most restrictive abortion laws, where freedom of choice was removed in 2020. It\u2019s very fresh as it is in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe political resonance of \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d especially rings true as its director, Mohammad Rasoulof, had to make the movie in secret and was subsequently sentenced to imprisonment and flogging shortly before its premiere in Cannes last year \u2014 he managed to flee the country. The film is highly critical of Iranian censorship, incorporating social media footage from protests around the country.\n\n\u201cThe Seed of the Scared Fig\u201d Courtesy of Neon\n\n\u201cThe nomination was interesting, not just because it represents professional success but because this film went through a lot of struggles to get made,\u201d Rasoulof says. \u201c[During filming], we never even thought about the Oscars even for a moment. We actually didn\u2019t even think we could finish the film.\u201d\n\nWith \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d exploring a politically volatile moment in Iran\u2019s history, Rasoulof also sees the larger impact with events that have shocked people around the world.\n\n\u201cThis [nomination] was like a gun shooting at censorship,\u201d Rasoulof says. \u201cThis film came out of the independent cinema of Iran and entered a very different course than what it was expected to enter. But also the fact that it was nominated by Germany was important because we\u2019re not confined within political borders.\u201d\n\nLike \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig,\u201d best picture nominee \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d grounds a larger political story about a terrifying historical moment through the perspective of one family\u2019s journey \u2014 in this case, during Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the light of a family at the beginning of the film and how that light is drained once an enormous injustice is committed,\u201d director Walter Salles says. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about how one can overcome loss. It tells so much about not only that family but the country as a whole. I\u2019ve always tried to do films in which the journey of the characters somehow intermingles with the journey of a country.\u201d\n\nWhile Denmark, France, Brazil and Germany have all landed multiple nominations in this category before, Lativia sees its first, with \u201cFlow.\u201d It also stands out from the other nominees because it\u2019s a dialogue-free animated film set in a fictional world where a group of animals are forced to band together after a natural disaster. It\u2019s only the third animated film to ever be nominated in the category, joining a \u201cWaltz With Bashir\u201d and \u201cFlee\u201d in that exclusive club.\n\n\u201cOur film was kind of hard to compare with anything. I wanted to make a film that both works as this adventure film with funny animals, so that would appeal to kids although I wasn\u2019t really thinking about that when pitching it,\u201d director Gints Zilbalodis admits. \u201cBut there\u2019s also the philosophical aspect about these themes that are very relevant with the flood, which could be seen as a real flood.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlow\u201d Janus Films and Sideshow\n\nZilbalodis hasn\u2019t been surprised by people thematically reading into his film as a warning for the future of climate change with no human beings featured in the world.\n\n\u201cThat comes back to not disrespecting kids and instead showing them that the world is complicated,\u201d Zilbalodis elaborates. \u201cOften in kids\u2019 films, you end the film and everything\u2019s perfect and the friends and heroes win. We wanted to have a sense of closure but we didn\u2019t want people to come out of the film feeling like everything\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\nSalles wasn\u2019t shy about seeing the increased relevance of his film following the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president last year. In his native Brazil, there was even an attempted coup in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe film resonates with current events in Brazil, but unfortunately not only in Brazil. We are living in a moment of utmost fragility of democracy in different parts of the world and I think this is in great part responsible for audience members saying, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not a film about the past. It\u2019s a film about who we are now,\u2019\u201d Salles says.",

      "title": "NRDC Analysis: Climate Action Can Improve Health in Rural India",
      "content": "This blog was coauthored by Dr. Ritika Kapoor and Charu Lata of NRDC India and Sameeha Hossain, a graduate student at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\nEnvironmental health risks in India are widespread and climate change is worsening many of them. Stifling heat waves are becoming longer and more intense, rainfall patterns are becoming more erratic, and harmful ozone air pollution\u2014already a threat to hundreds of thousands of people\u2014is poised to worsen in a warmer world.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Indian leaders across government, academia, and civil society are implementing a range of actions to both increase the deployment of renewable energy and invest in adaptation (climate preparedness). On the adaptation front, major strides have been made over the past 15 years to better equip Indian society for extreme temperatures, notably through Heat Action Plans (HAPs). The HAP approach has thus far been scaled widely and enhanced to better address mounting heat risks. Other major government initiatives, such as the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), seek to reduce dangerous levels of outdoor air pollution, particularly in the most polluted settings.\n\nRural India faces intense climate hazards\n\nBoth HAPs and the NCAP\u2014as well as a large number of climate change preparedness efforts worldwide\u2014are focused on highly populated urban areas. While India continues to rapidly urbanize and could be home to seven \u201cmegacities\u201d (populations exceeding 10 million each) by the end of this decade, a substantial portion of its population, about 60 percent, still resides in rural areas. These populations cope with many of the same climate-linked health threats as city dwellers but often have far fewer resources to prepare and adapt to climate change. For example, rural communities often face economic constraints, fewer educational opportunities, and weak infrastructures. Moreover, rural Indian households still rely on solid fuels like wood, crop waste, and animal dung to provide energy for cooking. These fuel sources burn inefficiently and contribute to dangerous levels of indoor air pollution.\n\nSince 2019, NRDC has partnered with the Self-Employed Women\u2019s Association (SEWA) to implement the Hariyali Gram (Green Village) project, which seeks to expand rural access to climate-friendly technologies in the areas of lighting, cooling, irrigation, and cooking. This effort, jointly funded by NRDC and SEWA, aims to alleviate energy poverty and advance rural climate action through implementation of policy and market-based solutions. Specifically, Hariyali Gram supports household installation of energy efficient indoor lighting and fans, village biogas plants for clean cooking, solar-powered water pumps for irrigation, and cool roofs to reduce indoor heat risks. Many of the Hariyali Gram interventions deployed to reduce the emissions of climate-changing pollution can also improve other aspects of life in rural settings by reducing indoor pollution, moderating indoor temperatures, and promoting gender equity.\n\nNew evidence of health gains\n\nA new commentary in the Journal of Change and Health offers early evidence of how these types of climate actions in rural India can help to improve people\u2019s health and well-being. Our commentary documents the early findings of a March 2024 survey fielded by SEWA staff to evaluate the household-level effects of Hariyali Gram initiatives in one village, Nagano Math in the state of Gujarat (home to approximately 256 households) The full survey results, spanning economic, social, and health topics, will be released this spring. Among our health findings summarized in the published article:\n\nHealth problems: Half of surveyed households overall reported family members with chronic health problems such as heart disease, asthma, and other lung diseases.\n\nHalf of surveyed households overall reported family members with chronic health problems such as heart disease, asthma, and other lung diseases. Air pollution: Overall, 88 percent of respondents acknowledged indoor air-quality problems worsened by combustion of solid fuels.\n\nOverall, 88 percent of respondents acknowledged indoor air-quality problems worsened by combustion of solid fuels. Cool roof benefits: Of 19 households that installed cool roofs as part of the program, 37 percent reported improved thermal comfort indoors.\n\nOf 19 households that installed cool roofs as part of the program, 37 percent reported improved thermal comfort indoors. Biogas stove benefits: Nine households received biogas installations, and 78 percent noted improved indoor air quality, while 66 percent observed enhanced outdoor air quality. In houses with biogas, 56 percent respondents reported health benefits from adopting cleaner cooking for themselves or other members of the household.\n\nThese early insights are promising, and as we work to expand implementation of Hariyali Gram in other rural settings, we are also making strides to more systematically monitor and evaluate its impacts so that we can maximize health and equity impacts for these climate-vulnerable communities and better understand how specific sub-populations, like women and children, are being served by Hariyali Gram interventions.\n\nScaling up rural climate action can benefit health\n\nClimate change impacts in India are already widespread and human vulnerability is vast; the early evidence presented in our commentary shows that even stronger ambition and sustained action can help to strengthen climate resilience of people living in rural India and improve their health in the process.",

      "title": "Researchers link India\u2019s food program to better health and stronger incomes",
      "content": "Despite humanity\u2019s scientific achievements and globalized economy, malnutrition remains a global issue. The United Nations estimated that 2.33 billion people experienced moderate or severe food insecurity in 2023.\n\nResearchers at UC Santa Barbara, the Indian Institute of Management and the University of Calgary examined the impacts of the world\u2019s largest food assistance program to understand its effectiveness. Their results, published in the American Economic Journal, reveal health and economic benefits that reach far beyond the caloric content of the subsidized food.\n\n\u201cMalnutrition in India has been this long-standing problem,\u201d said co-author Kathy Baylis, a professor in UCSB\u2019s Geography Department and the Environmental Markets Lab (emLab). \u201cStunting rates for children in India are the same as they are in some of the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa, even though it is a lot wealthier.\u201d As a result, India\u2019s Public Distribution System (PDS) is the world\u2019s largest food transfer program, and India\u2019s most far-reaching social safety net.\n\nPDS operates in a similar manner to how food stamps worked in the United States in decades past: Eligible families and individuals can purchase bags of rice or wheat at heavily subsidized rates. The PDS serves 800 million people and accounted for 60% of India\u2019s social assistance budget in 2019 through 2020, the paper explains.",

      "title": "Reconceptualizing menstrual health and hygiene among young women in India",
      "content": "Profile of the respondents\n\nTable 1 presents the background characteristics of 205,861 sampled women aged 15\u201324 years included in this study. The majority (64.3%) had never been married and most resided in rural areas (70.7%). Over two-thirds (67.9%) had attained secondary education, and an additional 19.4% higher education. The sample was largely Hindus (82.5%), followed by Muslims (13.4%) and Christians (1.8%). Socially, the largest proportion belonged to the Other Backward Classes (46.1%), while Scheduled Castes and Other categories represented 24.3% and 20%, respectively. In terms of wealth, the richest category represented 20.2% of the sample. As for media exposure, 41.5% of sampled women read newspapers, 14.4% listened to the radio, and 75.3% watched television. Furthermore, a significant proportion reported various barriers to accessing healthcare: obtaining permission to seek medical help (39.1%), obtaining money for treatment (50.9%), distance to health facilities (57.3%), and transportation challenges (55.1%).\n\nTable 1 Sample characteristics of women aged 15\u201324 years, India, NFHS-5 (2019\u201321) Full size table\n\nStatus of different components of MHH among girls and women aged 15\u201324 years in India, NFHS-5 (2019\u201321)\n\nIn India 78.6% women aged 15\u201324 years had access to water within premises, and 74.3% had soap available at the handwashing point. While nearly half (49.5%) reported using period products during menstruation, only 27.7% had access to all four essential MHH resources including using appropriate period products, an improved unshared toilet, water within the premises, and soap at the handwashing point. This indicates that a large majority of young women in India lack access to adequate MHH resources.\n\nAdequate MHH by background characteristics among young women, NFHS-5 (2019\u201321)\n\nTable 2 shows the prevalence of adequate MHH across background characteristics, revealing significant differences in access. Age at menarche showed a small positive association, with women experiencing menarche at 16 years or older having a slightly higher prevalence (31.4%) compared to those with menarche at age 12 or younger (28.4%). Marital status was strongly associated with adequate MHH; widowed, divorced, or separated women had the lowest prevalence (13.1%), followed by married women (21.5%), while never-married women had the highest prevalence (31.5%).\n\nTable 2 Percentages of adequate MHH by background characteristics, NFHS-5 (2019\u201321) Full size table\n\nEducation level demonstrated a significant role, with prevalence ranging from 5.4% among women with no formal education to 47.4% among those with higher education. Religion affiliation was also significant, with Christian women (38.3%) and women of other religions (50.8%) exhibiting higher prevalence than Hindu (27.2%) or Muslim (26.7%) women.\n\nWe observed significant differences across social groups, with women in the \u201cOther\u201d category having the highest prevalence (41.5%), followed by Other Backward Classes (27.6%), Scheduled Tribes (14.7%), and Scheduled Castes (22.3%). In the NFHS-5, the \u201cOther\u201d category within the social group classification refers to individuals who are not included in the three socioeconomically and historically marginalized groups officially designated by the Government of India: Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. \u201cOther\u201d is thus a residual category and it predominantly comprises individuals from caste groups occupying the upper levels of the caste-based social hierarchy. Wealth status, as measured by the asset index, was strongly and positively associated with adequate MHH, ranging from 4.7% for women from the poorest category to 59.0% among the richest. Place of residence revealed a substantial gap, with urban women (48%) having a much higher prevalence than rural women (19.4%).\n\nRegional disparities were also evident, with the North (44.8%) and West (40.3%) showing higher prevalence than other regions. Media exposure was positively associated with adequate MHH, while barriers to healthcare access (permission, financial, distance, transportation) were associated with lower prevalence.\n\nGeographical disparities in adequate MHH across the Indian districts\n\nFigure 1 highlights substantial district-level variations in access to adequate MHH across India, ranging from 2.3% in the Karimganj district (Assam) to 89.4% in the Champhai district (Mizoram). 25% of districts had very low prevalence rates (below 16%), concentrated primarily in the states of Uttar Pradesh (31), Madhya Pradesh (18), Odisha (18), Jharkhand (16), Chhattisgarh (14), Assam (11), and parts of Karnataka (7) and West Bengal (6).\n\nFig. 1 District-wise access to adequate MHH in India, NFHS-5, 2019\u201321. Full size image\n\nDeterminants of adequate MHH among girls and women aged 15\u201324 years in India, NFHS-5 (2019\u201321)\n\nTable 3 presents the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from multivariate logistic regression. Several factors were significantly associated with the odds of having access to adequate MHH. Compared to never-married women, currently married women had significantly lower odds (AOR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.85). Education level showed a strong positive association, with each increase in education level associated with progressively higher odds of adequate MHH. Women with higher education had over three times the odds of adequate access (AOR: 3.23, 95% CI: 2.89, 3.60) compared to women with no formal education. Similarly, wealth as measured by the asset index, demonstrated a strong positive gradient. Women in the richest quintile had nearly ten times the odds of adequate MHH (AOR: 9.92, 95% CI: 9.11, 10.81), compared to those in the poorest quintile.\n\nTable 3 Biodemographic and socioeconomic factors associated with adequate MHH in India, NFHS-5 (2019\u201321) Full size table\n\nReligious affiliation, social group, place of residence, and region of residence also showed significant associations. Muslim women (AOR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.92), Scheduled Castes (AOR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.75), Scheduled Tribes (AOR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.65), and Other Backward Classes (AOR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.85) all had lower odds of adequate MHH compared to Hindu women and the \u201cOther\u201d social group, respectively. Regionally, women in the Northern and Western regions had approximately twice the odds of adequate access compared to those in the Central region.\n\nPlace of residence played a significant role in adequate MHH, as urban women had higher odds of practicing adequate MHH (AOR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.90, 2.04) compared to rural women. The region of residence was also associated with varying odds of adequate MHH.\n\nMedia exposure, specifically reading newspapers (AOR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.38,1.52) at least once a week, was positively associated with adequate MHH. Among the barriers to accessing medical help, financial constraints (AOR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.82), distance to health facilities (AOR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89, 0.97), and transportation issues (AOR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.93) were all significantly associated with lower odds of adequate MHH.\n\nResults of Fairlie decomposition analysis\n\nWe conducted a Fairlie decomposition analysis to quantify the predictors contributing to the disparity in adequate MHH access between the top and bottom quartile of districts. The mean predicted probabilities of adequate access for the bottom and top quartiles were 0.53 and 0.11, respectively, indicating a substantial gap of 0.42.\n\nOur analysis revealed that 72.8% of this gap was explained by the predictors included in our model. Of this explained portion, 76.4% was attributable to differences in the distribution of just three predictors: asset index, area of residence, and region of residence. These findings highlight the crucial role of sociodemographic and geographic factors in shaping disparities in adequate MHH access. However, approximately 27% of the gap remained unexplained by our model, suggesting the potential influence of unmeasured factors not captured in the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5 data. These unmeasured factors could include individual-level factors like knowledge and attitudes related to MHH, community-level factors such as social norms and stigma, and programmatic factors like the availability and quality of MHH interventions.\n\nTable 4 provides a more detailed breakdown of decomposition results, expressing each predictor\u2019s contribution as a percentage of the explained gap. The asset index emerged as the most significant contributor, accounting for 36.5% of the explained disparity between high- and low-performing districts. Region of residence (23.6%) and place of residence (16.7%) were the next most influential factors. Education level and exposure to reading newspapers also made notable contributions (6.3% and 4.7%, respectively).",

      "title": "The indefatigable ASHA worker, central to India\u2019s healthcare system, seeks proportionate compensation",
      "content": "The backbone of India\u2019s rural healthcare system, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) workers have played a major role in improving both maternal and child health, immunisation rates and the overall well-being of the community; they are also key to bridging the gap between rural communities and primary healthcare.\n\nEver since ASHAs were appointed in 2005 under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), they have played a pivotal role, including in spreading awareness about nutrition and sanitation facilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, their role in healthcare expanded in an exponential manner.\n\nASHAs are selected from the community, primarily women between 25-45 years through a rigorous process involving community groups, anganwadis, self-help groups, village health committees, block nodal officers, district nodal officers and the general body of villages. After the selection, the ASHA workers go through a series of training programmes to enable them to execute their roles.\n\nASHA means \u2018hope\u2019 in Hindi, reflects what these workers bring to people from lower socio-economic backgrounds, through their roles. However, talking to ASHA workers reveals their side of the story - a not-so-happy story. Overworked and underpaid among frontline health workers, their anger and distress runs high. Ironically, this pink-clad all female group, won the WHO\u2019s 2022 global leaders\u2019 award, recognising their contributions to global health, leadership and commitment to regional health issues.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, there were two or three prolonged strikes regarding the payment of salaries. The payment of ASHAs is based on the performance and the age of the worker. In addition, workers get certain incentives: initially this was a sum of \u20b9500. In 2015, the Central government increased salaries and they started getting \u20b92,000, then in 2016 they got an increase of \u20b91,500. Then in the COVID era, in 2021, they got an increase of \u20b91,250. In 2024, there were strikes for a month, and they got a raise of \u20b95,000 and certain additional performance-incentives. As of now, on an average an ASHA gets \u20b916,000 per month,\u201d says M.A. Patil, ASHA Workers Union leader based in Thane, Mumbai.\n\nDespite these incremental pay raises, many workers continue to feel that their compensation does not acknowledge the true magnitude of their contribution to society. The work of ASHAs is not to be taken lightly. During the pandemic, they took Covid-19 tests, made sure home isolation was being taken seriously, and held awareness campaigns. The dark side of their work though is this -- ASHA workers are said to be volunteers. Therefore, their core salary per month stands at a \u20b93,000. This, of course, excludes the seemingly toxic point-based incentive system. Over the past few years, ASHA worker unions have staged protests all across the country, citing a lack of amenities and demanding the payment of arrears, as well as mental and social security services.\n\nHigh maternal and infant mortality rates have often been a cause for concern in rural areas and have been pressing concerns, and ASHAs have been tasked with promoting hospital deliveries, providing antenatal and postnatal care and improving the overall health of children via immunisations and nutritional support. The NRHM has endeavored to construct a decentralised and community-based approach to health, and ASHA workers are key in facilitating healthcare. A study by Bajpai and Dholakia (2011) states, \u201cThe ASHA program represents an innovative attempt to involve local women in improving access to healthcare services, particularly in areas where formal healthcare infrastructure is weak.\u201d\n\nForming sisterhoods\n\nOn the bright side, several women have found sisterhood in the circle. Neeraj Devi\u2019s best friend Madhu, has been her only source of solace ever since her husband passed away in 2023. His death was a tragic accident. \u201cMadhu has offered me warmth and told me to have faith in myself. She has been the one to assure me that this tough time of grief and poverty will pass.\u201d\n\nMadhu herself lives with her husband who has been physically abusive in the past. \u201cI started working as an ASHA worker, hoping that I would, one day, be able to not depend on him. Being an ASHA worker enabled me to do that. The amount of respect that I have for myself is different, and I think it scares my husband that I do not depend on him. The money has enabled me to buy clothes and school supplies for my children.\u201d\n\nMadhu\u2019s neighbour, Pinki Devi\u2019s situation is somewhat similar. \u201cMy husband used to hit me with anything that he could find. I was married off at 17. My mother-in-law used to berate me and hit me as well. I\u2019ve been suicidal. Being an ASHA worker has allowed me to step away from my family and gain some sense of self.\u201d\n\nFor Neeraj, however, things look grim. \u201cI used to love being an ASHA worker. I felt like I was truly making a difference to women\u2019s lives. There have been cases when no one has been with the mothers apart from I. However the pay is so low, and the system of incentives, venomous. It takes a toll. After my husband\u2019s death, I was torn apart. I slogged to earn about \u20b99,000 [per month] with incentives. I have two young children who go to school. I can barely afford to pay for gas and food, and the burden of it all, breaks my heart.\u201d\n\nWorking as employees, paid like volunteers\n\nMadhu too agrees. \u201cWe have to work as though we are government employees but are paid as though we are solely volunteers. Often, deliveries happen at night. We leave our homes in the middle of the night, and our husbands often berate us, saying we are unable to give time to our families and the money is barely enough to justify that.\u201d\n\nOther issues also include harassment that the women face on the street, whilst spreading information about sexual wellness. \u201cThere have been occasions when men mime at us and make obscene gestures. All we can do is try to ignore them,\u201d Pinki says.\n\nBeyond the systematic challenges, ASHAs find strength in their community and amongst themselves. The journey of ASHA workers epitomises their dedication in the midst of extreme adversities. Their stories ask for the need for systematic reforms to ensure fair compensation, safe working environments and social security. As the backbone of India\u2019s rural healthcare system, it is essential that their contributions are recognised and their challenges are addressed.\n\n(The authors are freelancers. madhumitasharma9318@gmail.com and treya.sinha@gmail.com)",

      "content": "Actrec power\n\nSlow change\n\nA necessity, not option\n\nMUMBAI: There is a silent \"green\" change taking place in many city hospitals. From generating solar power, using special insulation to cut energy losses, treating wastewater, or using sensor lights, many hospitals are taking baby steps or unleashing elaborate plans to get green certification\u2014in silver, gold, or platinum categories\u2014for their buildings.On February 4, on World Cancer Day, Tata Memorial Centre's ACTREC, Kharghar, showcased its 3-phase plan to use solar power in a big way to cut down on carbon emissions and save over Rs 1 crore a year when the plan is fully operational.In a private hospital in the western suburbs, the authorities started with one step\u2014installing sensor lights in bathrooms\u2014that saved them Rs 25 lakh last year. The three Fortis Hospitals in the city have an \u2018environmental, social and governance' department each that focuses on optimising energy consumption, water usage, and correct biomedical waste management. \"We managed a reduction in per occupied bed energy by 3.4% and a reduction in per occupied bed water consumption by 8.4%,\" said a spokesperson.\"We unveiled successful solarisation of ACTREC on World Cancer Day,\" said Dr Rashneh Pardiwala of the Centre for Environmental Research and Education (CERE) whose \u2018Switch on Solar' programme aims to make India's healthcare sector adopt renewable energy. Supported by BNP Paribas India, the solarisation project's first phase will help the cancer hub save Rs 50 lakh by the end of the first year of installation, she added. CERE's Switch on Solar initiative has helped 50 institutions \u2014 schools, colleges, hospitals, old age homes, rescue centres.\"Hospitals like ACTREC, with their energy-intensive infrastructure, rely heavily on electricity for hi-tech diagnostic equipment, 24-hour treatment and operations, advanced research laboratories, air conditioning, and other world-class facilities,\" said Dr Pardiwala. The solarisation project will help the hospital shift to a clean energy source while reducing its carbon footprint. \"Beyond environmental benefits, cost savings from reduced electricity expenses will be redirected toward providing free cancer treatment, amplifying ACTREC's capacity to support patients from marginalised backgrounds,\" she added.The green movement in the hospital sector has been visible for the last five years, said Dr Vivek Desai of healthcare consultancy firm, HOSMAC. \"It's mandatory for medical colleges to adopt environmentally friendly technologies and be green, but it's voluntary for the private sector,\" he said. A few years back, Hitachi India Pvt Ltd completed a green makeover for All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Delhi for free by installing a rooftop solar power system and upgrading its power infrastructure to achieve a 30% reduction in energy consumption.\"Considering that energy-saving ways and installations help save money in the long run, private hospitals have begun investing in the greening process despite the initial high investment,\" said Dr Desai. For instance, it is expensive and unhealthy for hospitals with 50 beds or more to have window or split ACs in their rooms. While the initial investment of installing a central air-conditioning system is high, costs can be recovered within three to four years. This change improves indoor air quality and use of non-toxic materials reduces indoor pollutants, creating a healthier environment for patients, staff, and visitors, according to the Indian Green Building Council set up by Confederation of Indian Industry that provides green ratings to hospitals.\"Every hospital spends 4% of its revenue on energy bills. If an investment helps them save even 1%, the savings would be in crores for a mid-sized hospital,\" said Dr Desai, whose firm doesn't take on projects that don't aim for a silver certification from IGBC.A study in the \u2018Journal of Management Research and Analysis' in 2020 by a team from Mewati Govt Medical College in Haryana noted that various environmentally conscious strategies could help reduce a hospital building's operating costs by 8.9%, increase its value by 7.5%, and increase its occupancy ratio by 3.5%.",

According to the World Bank, infant mortality in India fell from 66 to 38 per 1,000 live births from 2000 to 2015. Life expectancy at birth has increased from 63 to 68 years, and the maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 374 to 174 per 100,000 live births over the same period.\n\nIndia also has dynamic pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries; world-class scientists, including a burgeoning clinical trials industry; and leading hospitals that attract foreign patients and treat its better-off citizens.\n\nYet Indian government and public health officials agree that the country also faces persistent and daunting public health challenges, particularly for the poor. These include child undernutrition and low birth weights that often lead to premature death or lifelong health problems; high rates of neonatal and maternal mortality; growth in noncommunicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and tobacco use, leading to cancer and other diseases; and high rates of road traffic accidents that result in injuries and deaths.\n\nAs the Indian government strives to provide comprehensive health coverage for all, the country\u2019s rapidly developing health system remains an area of concern. There are disparities in health and health care systems between poorer and richer states and underfunded health care systems that in many cases are inefficiently run and underregulated. New government-financed health insurance programs are increasing coverage, but insurance remains limited.\n\nPublic and private health systems are placing huge demands on the country\u2019s capacity to train exceptional health leaders and professionals. Rising to meet these challenges, the people of India have an opportunity to have a major influence on their own future health and on the future of public health and medical efforts globally.\n\nSupporting Development of India\u2019s Health Workforce\n\nHarvard Chan School is collaborating with partners across India to address those challenges. Together, the School and its partners are introducing educational innovations to India to expand skills training, degree programs, and leadership development at new schools and institutes of public health. We seek to leverage the School\u2019s resources to help strengthen public health training and build capacity across the health sector in India.",

      "title": "What's Driving Violence Against Health Workers in India",
      "content": "On November 13, 2024, Balaji Jagannathan, a senior oncologist at Kalaignar Centenary Super Speciality Hospital in Tamil Nadu, a southern state of India, was brutally stabbed seven times by the son of a woman he had treated. Although severely wounded, Jagannathan survived.\n\nThe patient had been diagnosed with end-stage cancer and received six cycles of chemotherapy at Kalaignar. Despite treatment, the cancer metastasized, which enraged her family.\n\nThe attack on Jagannathan is a grim reflection of a growing epidemic of violence against health-care workers across India. An incident is reported almost every other week.\n\nMany doctors and health workers believe that the media's portrayal of doctors and modern medicine plays a large role in reinforcing the existing frustrations against India's health-care system. Talking to the press from her hospital bed after her son attacked Jagannathan, the patient blamed the doctor for her condition's becoming terminal. \"If the doctor hadn't failed his duty, I would not be this ill. I don't know what occurred to my son [to do this] out of his love for me. He went down the wrong road,\" she said.\n\n\"More than the numbers, what is alarming is the general public's reaction to these incidents,\" says Srujun Vadranapu, an orthopedic surgeon in Coimbatore, a city in Tamil Nadu. \"I looked through the news report of this incident, and what shocked me was the number of comments by readers saying that doctors have become lazy and deserve to be beaten up. The public sentiment against doctors is predominantly negative.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of this incident, TheNewsMinute reported that people made violent threats against health professionals on social media, some saying they were sorry that Jagannathan had survived. The posts said he deserved to die because his treatment had failed and that other doctors should take the attack as a warning.\n\nShifting Portrayals\n\n\"A few decades ago, doctors were portrayed as demigods in cinema,\" says Mukul Kapoor, head of anesthesiology and critical care at Amrita Hospital in Faridabad. \"In movies such as Anand (1971) and Amar Kahani (1949), for example, the doctors were shown to be selfless individuals who always put their patients' needs above themselves, working for little to no money and being of service.\"\n\nDoctors believe that the media's portrayal of medicine plays a large role in reinforcing the existing frustrations\n\nBut the tide eventually turned, says Kapoor, and movies began villainizing doctors\u2014a reflection of public frustration with India's health system.\n\n\"Recently, movies have begun to portray doctors as evil, money-minded, and lazy,\" says Kapoor. He cites the example of the movie Ramanaa (2002), which shows doctors operating on a patient who was already dead to earn money and ignoring a patient in childbirth because they were busy watching a cricket match on television.\n\nSuch portrayals are harmful, says Kapoor. \"Medicine is a science and a fallible one at that. Every disease has a different prognosis and a few variables one can control. Those, too, are severely limited by the resources available at hand at the time. Only a very few bad outcomes are due to human error. So, treating doctors as demigods or villains makes no sense,\" he says.\n\nIn Mersal (2017), for instance, the protagonist is a well-loved doctor who treats every patient with any disease for just five rupees (about $0.06). In India, a strip of the cheapest brand of 10 500-mg Paracetamol tablets to treat fever or moderate pain costs about eight rupees (about $0.09). It's difficult to believe that even a fictional doctor would treat an illness for this price.\n\nHowever unreasonable this might sound to health-care workers or policymakers, says Kapoor, this is what the Indian general public expects. They want private health care to be free or nominally priced. They don't want to go to public hospitals, which are free (or nominally priced), because of infrastructure issues, overcrowding, and worries about care being of bad quality.\n\n\"Their expectations of quality health care at nominal prices are very reasonable,\" says Mohammad Aslam Ali, a dermatologist in Guwahati. \"However, these issues are systemic, and the public demand and pressure must be on government authorities and elected representatives.\"\n\nAli says patients and their families who decide to vent their anger and frustration at health-care providers are short sighted:\n\nA woman walks past a closed gate of R G Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata, India, on August 19, 2024. REUTERS/Sahiba Chawdhary\n\n\"Indian media are knowingly or unknowingly peddling this shortsightedness. If a patient feels ripped off by a private hospital, [they believe] it's the doctor's fault for being well paid rather than the corporate greed of the hospital administrators.\"\n\n\"Similarly, when a patient receives low-quality care at a public hospital, people believe it is because the doctor is lazy rather than because the hospital is inadequately staffed or has severe resource limitations. They do not consider that elected representatives have not invested in the system.\"\n\nImproving Health Literacy\n\nJayadatt Pawar, an upper gastrointestinal tract surgeon from Bangalore, says that unbalanced reporting in news media is a significant contributor to the growing distrust between the public and health-care workers.\n\n\"Indian journalists often focus exclusively on the patient's perspective, leaving the doctor's side of the story unheard,\" he says. This one-sided approach, he argues, not only misrepresents medical realities but also exacerbates public anger toward doctors.\n\nPawar says health reporting in India frequently lacks scientific rigor and factual grounding. \"There is no explanation in the news about the patient's medical condition, the available treatment options, or the realistic outcomes. Such details would help ground the narrative in facts, not emotions, but they are often ignored.\"\n\nHe stresses the importance of having science-literate journalists cover health-related stories. \"Science-related stories should be communicated by journalists who understand the subject. This ensures the nuances are captured accurately, leading to informed and balanced reporting.\"\n\nGayatri Sharma, an emergency physician and medical illustrator based in Mumbai, says major information differences between health-care providers and patients in India complicates the problem. \"This information asymmetry exists partly because the Indian health-care system is not transparent and partly because of poor health literacy in the general population.\"\n\nThe primary way to break this cycle of violence is by investing in improving health-care infrastructure in public health systems\n\nVadranapu notes that when he was in France on a fellowship, he worked with an orthopedic surgeon specializing in upper-limb problems. \"I was amazed at the way the patients were able to understand and communicate with the physician. They could hear about their options calmly and collaboratively make decisions with the treating doctor because they had good health literacy. This has not been my experience in India.\"\n\n\"A poor ability to comprehend health information is not the function of a lack of education per se, but instead a lack of basic health-related education,\" says Pawar, adding that he has treated highly educated patients who could not grasp their treatment options and their implications.\n\nPawar says that health literacy should be a part of everyone's education beginning in high school. \"A few hours dedicated to teaching people accurate information not only about how their bodies work but also about how medical systems work and how evidence-based medicine is practiced is crucial to ensure that people understand the medical information communicated to them via media and their health-care providers.\"\n\nComplementing this, regular community outreach programs and public awareness campaigns can help demystify the limitations and complexities of modern medicine, fostering trust between patients and health-care providers, says Sharma.\n\nA study published in 2013 shows that a community-based educational intervention in south India for pregnant women with anemia was successful in improving their understanding of the condition and empowered them to make better health decisions, such as choosing iron-rich foods and supplementing their diets with iron therapy.\n\nPawar says the media's lack of factual grounding and widespread health illiteracy creates a dangerous cycle of misinformation and misplaced blame.\n\nHe cites a clip of an Indian television series that went viral of a man dying during surgery. When the surgeon breaks the news to the family, the wife, who isn't a health worker, says the doctor can't be right and asks to go into the operating room. She dons scrubs and operates on her husband, saving his life with the power of her love. \"These are the tropes being peddled to the Indian population,\" Pawar says.\n\nHealth literacy should be a part of everyone's education beginning in high school\n\nPawar remarks unrealistic portrayals of disease conditions and miracle cures that permeate the Indian fictional entertainment world interplay with poor health literacy and media literacy to create barriers that prevent the population from fully understanding the complexities of modern medicine.\n\n\"These very same movies and television series in India offer people a resolution to their frustrations by portraying violence against the villains [doctors or health professionals] as a feasible answer in these scenarios. This, too, promotes the use of immediate violence to avenge perceived slights,\" says Karun Saathveeg, a third-year medical resident at Gangaram Hospital in Delhi.\n\n\"The primary way to break this cycle of violence is by investing in improving health-care infrastructure in public health systems and standardizing rates across the private hospitals and making them transparent to the patients,\" says Sharma.\n\nHealth workers across India have been protesting and demanding a central law to address violence against health-care workers. On top of this, Pawar says, is a real need to demand media accountability and responsibility to help bridge the gap of mistrust between the health system and the public.\n\nPawar says developing and adhering to ethical guidelines for health-related coverage can promote balanced, factual narratives, counter sensationalism, and prevent undue vilification of health-care professionals.\n\nHe says it's also necessary to advocate for responsible storytelling in film and television. This can be achieved when filmmakers and content creators collaborate with health professionals to create accurate portrayals of modern medicine and its challenges.\n\n\"Media has burned the bridge between the general population and health-care workers, but it has the power and the responsibility to rebuild it,\" says Pawar.\n\nDoctors hold candles during a protest rally demanding justice, following the rape and murder of a trainee medic at a hospital in Kolkata, in New Delhi, India, on August 16, 2024.

      "title": "Kerala: Breaking the taboo around 'living wills' in India",
      "content": "Dying with dignity: Breaking the taboo around 'living wills' in India\n\n7 days ago Cherylann Mollan BBC News, Mumbai\n\nGetty Images Health activists are helping champion the idea of living wills in India\n\nIn 2010, IP Yadev, a surgeon from the southern Indian state of Kerala, was confronted with one of the hardest decisions of his life. He had to decide between keeping his father - a terminal cancer patient - alive, and honouring his wish, expressed verbally, to stop all treatments and put an end to his suffering. Warning: This article contains some distressing details \"As a son, I felt it was my duty to do whatever I could to prolong my father's life. This made him unhappy and he ended up dying alone in an intensive-care unit. The doctor's last efforts to revive him using CPR crushed his ribs. It was a horrible death,\" Dr Yadev says. The experience, he says, deeply impacted him and helped him realise the importance of advance medical directives (AMDs), also known as living wills. A living will is a legal document that allows a person over 18 years to choose the medical care they would want to receive if they develop a terminal illness or condition with no hope of recovery and are unable to make decisions by themselves. For example, they could specify that they don't want to be put on life-support machines or insist that they want to be given adequate pain-relieving medication. In 2018, India's Supreme Court allowed people to draw up living wills and thereby choose passive euthanasia, where medical treatment can be withdrawn under strict guidelines to hasten a person's death. Active euthanasia - any act that intentionally helps a person kill themselves - is illegal in the country. But despite the legal go-ahead, the concept of living wills hasn't really taken off in India. Experts say that this has much to do with the way Indians talk, or rather, don't talk about death. Death is often considered to be a taboo subject and any mention of it is thought to bring bad luck. But there are now efforts underway to change this. In November, Dr Yadev and his team launched India's first programme - at the Government Medical College in Kerala's Kollam district - to educate people about living wills, offering information in person and over the phone. Volunteers also conduct awareness campaigns and distribute will templates.\n\nIP Yadev Volunteers at the information counter on living wills in the government-run hospital at Kollam, Kerala\n\nCreating a living will requires family members to have open and honest conversations about death. Despite some resistance, activists and institutions are taking steps to raise awareness, and there's a growing, though cautious, interest. Kerala leads the way in these conversations. Currently, it has the country's best palliative care network, and organisations that offer end-of-life care have also started awareness campaigns around living wills. In March, around 30 people from the Pain and Palliative Care society in Thrissur city signed living wills. Dr E Divakaran, founder of the society, says that the gesture is aimed at make the idea more popular among people. \"Most people have never heard of the term so they have many questions, like whether such a directive can be misused or if they can make changes to their wills later on,\" Mr Yadev says, adding that most inquiries have come from people in their 50s and 60s. \"Right now, it's the educated, upper-middle class that's making use of the facility. But with grassroot awareness campaigns, we're expecting the demographic to widen,\" he says. According to the Supreme Court order, a person must draft the will, sign it in the presence of two witnesses, and have it attested by a notary or gazetted officer. A copy of the will must then be submitted to a state government-appointed custodian. While the guidelines exist on paper, many state governments are yet to set up mechanisms to implement them. This is what Dr Nikhil Datar, a gynaecologist from Mumbai city, realised when he made his living will two years ago as there was no custodian to whom he could submit it.\n\nNikhil Datar Dr Nikhil Datar (right) handing over his living will to the custodian",

      "content": "Latest News \u2022 June 06, 2024\n\nUAB attends global health symposium in Manipal, India\n\nWritten by: Kayla Gibson\n\nGlobal health partners from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) participated in the Global Health Consortium Symposium hosted by the Manipal Academy of Higher Education. This event served as a platform for students from collaborating universities to convene in Manipal, India, where they engaged in comprehensive learning experiences focused on health system mapping supported by faculty.\n\nUAB is part of the Global Health Consortium of ten institutions in high- and low-income countries and participated in the symposium this year for the first time to gain crucial insights from diverse global partners. The consortium provides a robust academic network, offering students invaluable resources. Recognizing the potential benefits for both students and faculty, the symposium was offered as part of the UAB Master of Science in Global Health (MSGH) degree jointly provided by the UAB Heersink School of Medicine and the UAB School of Public Health.\n\nThrough a blend of field visits, stakeholder interviews, group collaboration, and expert-led lectures, students gained valuable insights into the intricacies of health care systems. Additionally, participants had the unique opportunity to showcase their ongoing research endeavors.\n\n\u201cUAB\u2019s active participation and support of the symposium in Manipal, India, tangibly demonstrates the breadth of educational and professional development experiences our students should expect to get in the MSGH degree,\u201d said Matt Heimann, M.D., associate director for Educational Programs for the UAB Mary Heersink Institute for Global Health (UAB MHIGH). \u201cIt is evident that they will be equipped with pragmatic research tools and be exposed to a global classroom that will translate into enhanced professional opportunities.\u201d\n\nHeimann and other MSGH degree leaders wanted to give students an invaluable firsthand experience by attending this event. Participants were able to interact with peers from diverse nationalities and backgrounds. The in-person platform for global engagement expanded their global networks and provided an opportunity to enhance their ability to operate seamlessly in a global health environment with collaborators from various backgrounds.\n\n\u201cOur MSGH degree is a uniquely innovative collaboration between the UAB schools of medicine and public health,\u201d said Alan T. N. Tita, M.D., Ph.D., senior associate dean for Global and Women\u2019s Health and UAB MHIGH Director. \u201cBy participating in a global consortium alongside nine other institutions in both low- and high-income countries, the program amplifies opportunities for our students and faculty to both engage in a global classroom of online core courses and then acquire hands-on experience in-person in India.\u201d\n\nWith this being UAB's inaugural participation in the symposium since launching the MSGH degree, the primary objectives were centered on educational enrichment and collaborative group work, mapping local health systems in resource-constrained environments, and applying classroom-learned global health skills in practical settings. Moreover, it was anticipated that the symposium would provide a platform for international experts to offer tailored feedback on students' ongoing research projects, further enhancing their professional development.\n\n\u201cI was deeply impressed with how the students were so supportive of each other during the weekend conference with all the thesis proposals and scholarly paper descriptions,\u201d said Paul Erwin, M.D., dean of the UAB School of Public Health. \u201cI know one of our students, Divya Annamalai, had a great experience at Manipal, and I look forward to returning next year with more students.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of presenting their master's thesis research and meeting their virtual peers from McMaster University in person added significant appeal to the experience.\n\n\"The two-week experience, featuring exploration of the Indian health care system, collaborative group work, discussions with diverse individuals, and extensive networking seemed like a valuable opportunity,\" said Divya Annamalai, a research assistant for Sparkman Center for Global Health who was the first and sole MSGH student from UAB to attend the symposium.. \"The opportunity allowed us to explore the mental health care system in Uddupi and identify both the gaps and strides, particularly concerning continuum of care.\u201d\n\nThe cultural exchange within their group left a lasting impression, emphasizing the importance of cross-cultural communication and collaboration.\n\n\"The MSGH program has been incredibly rewarding... allowing me to expand my knowledge, perspectives, and innovative thinking in global health,\u201d said Annamalai.\n\nLooking ahead to her future endeavors in medical school, Annamalai aims to integrate her learnings to advance health equity and access.\n\nThe symposium's diverse participant base, comprising over 270 students from nine universities, facilitated valuable networking opportunities and exposure to high-impact material. To ensure successful participation, UAB's delegation undertook meticulous preparations. The opportunity was shared with students, orientation sessions were conducted, and support was enlisted from faculty at McMaster University and Maastricht University. Additionally, senior leaders from the UAB Heersink School of Medicine and the UAB School of Public Health provided vital support, both financially and through active participation in the symposium, underscoring the significance of the experience.\n\n\u201cIn my almost 40 years of working in public health, I have never seen or experienced anything quite like this symposium in India,\u201d said Erwin. \u201cIn a recent meeting with UAB leadership, Dean Agarwal and I were both able to report on what an incredible opportunity this was for UAB, and how uplifting it was to see students and faculty from such a wide range of countries working in solidarity to address the great global health challenges of our times.\u201d\n\nBoth Dean Erwin and Anupam Agarwal, M.D., dean of the UAB Heersink School of Medicine, were excited to see the impact the symposium had on UAB students and looking forward to seeing the benefits of future opportunities available to MSGH students.\n\n\"UAB\u2019s active participation and support of the Global Health Symposium in Manipal, India, exemplifies the rich educational and professional development experiences our MSGH students can expect,\" said Agarwal. \"This engagement equips our students with invaluable research tools, real-world experience, and enhanced professional opportunities while forging global connections that benefit both UAB faculty and students.\"\n\nThe Global Health Consortium includes Ahfad University for Women (Sudan), Bangladesh University of Professionals (Bangladesh), Maastricht University (Netherlands), Manipal Academy of Higher Education (India), McMaster University (Canada), Niigata University (Japan), Thammasat University (Thailand), Universidad del Rosario (Columbia), University of Alabama at Birmingham (United States), and University of South-Eastern Norway (Norway).",

Replying to supplementary questions in the Rajya Sabha, Nadda highlighted the steps taken by the government in the last 10 years to strengthen India's health system, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.India has proven under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that we have got a very robust system to address the issue of any pandemic that comes, the minister said.Listing out India's capabilities, Nadda said the country has the National Center for Disease Control NCDC ), which oversees and keeps surveillance.\"It is the apex body which takes care of the diseases and the pathogens, and the other emerging virus mutation, which takes place,\" he added.Under the NCDC, he said the country has an integrated disease surveillance programme, a platform for disease surveillance.\"We have got the RRT, which is called the rapid response team, which is there in the states. And we have got very decentralised multidisciplinary teams for health control and containment. And also, we have got an integrated health information platform where advanced data with analysis and analytical data and data modelling tools are there,\" the minister said.\"We give real-time reporting for all the emerging pandemics or the there are chances of having any pandemic.\"The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has 150 labs, he said, adding that there are viral research diagnostic laboratories. India has a world-class National Institute of Virology in Pune.\"So, we have got a very robust system wherever any pandemic or any chances of the pandemic are there, these laboratories confirm what type of mutation is taking place, what change, what type of medicine or what type of treatment is to be given,\" Nadda said.The minister further said the Prime Minister has taken one step forward and launched the National One Health Mission \"We get diseases because of pesticides. We get diseases because of the environment. We get diseases because of the nature of the plants, which is changing. We get diseases because of the medicines that are being given to the animals. What is the impact altogether? So for that, we have also started (a programme), which is known as the National One Health Mission,\" the minister said.In a written reply, Nadda said the prevention of and preparedness against the pandemic is a shared global responsibility.In order to better prepare against future pandemics/public health emergencies in the country, the ministry provides requisite support to states/UTs to enhance their capabilities.",

      "title": "Trends and determinants of maternal health services utilization in India from 2015 to 2021",
      "content": "Globally, tremendous progress has been made by countries to improve maternal mortality, resulting in a 34% reduction in maternal deaths from 2000 to 2020 1. Despite this progress, over 800 mothers die each day and 99% of these deaths are reported from low and middle-income countries (LMICs)1. India contributes to 18% of global maternal deaths, and with 24,000 deaths in 2020, India is the highest contributor to maternal deaths among South Asian countries1. Over the years, a declining trend has been observed in India\u2019s maternal mortality ratio (MMR), from 372 in 2000 to 117 in 2020, but spatial heterogeneity persists1. The southern states attained the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target-3.1 of reducing MMR to less than 70 by 2030, where MMR declined from 127 to 49 (per 100,000 live births) between 2007 and 20202. During the same period, MMR in low-performing empowered action group (EAG) states and Assam, declined from 308 to 137, while in other states, MMR declined to 76 from 149 (per 100,000 live births)2, indicating variable progress in different parts of India in meeting the UN MMR target. Recent evidence indicates 90% (576/640) of districts in India still have an MMR of > 70 (per 100,000 live births), and in 128 districts (20%), the MMR is > 200 (per 100,000 live births)3.\n\nThe cause of maternal deaths varies across different states in India\u2014 obstetric hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders contribute to > 30% of maternal mortality, whereas anemia (25%), malaria (1%), and tuberculosis (1%) are the key indirect causes of maternal deaths4. Even though hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in all states, the proportion of maternal deaths is higher due to hypertensive disorders in the states with better socio-economic indices such as Kerala, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu5. The time taken to seek obstetric care is another important factor that contributes to maternal deaths. This factor is extensively studied by Thaddeus and Maine- using the Three-Delays Model in low-middle-income countries6. The delay by pregnant women and her family (level 1, 6.3\u201360.6%) and the delays at a health facility (level 3, 2.7\u201368.2%) are important contributors to maternal deaths in India7. The level-3 delay in specific, nudge towards diverse and complex issues of the Indian health system mainly in the high focus EAG states. Some of the broader health systems issues that impact the availability, quality, and utilization of maternal health services in these states are: vacancies and absenteeism of health personnel at public health facilities, skill shortages, dysfunctional referral systems, shortages of medical supplies, corruption, misinformation, poor management of health services and under-reporting of morbidity and mortality data8,9,10. The under-reporting of maternal mortality data remains a key concern in India11. Evidence suggests less than 50% of maternal deaths get reported in the country under the existing health management information system4. Inaccuracies in maternal mortality data may lead to poor evidence-based planning and skewed implementation of maternal health schemes, complicating efforts to reduce MMR in India.\n\nThe Indian Government has been implementing safe motherhood schemes from time to time to improve the utilization of maternal health services; launched in 2005, the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) - a safe motherhood scheme that aims to increase institutional delivery and post-delivery care by providing conditional cash transfer to economically weak pregnant women in all Indian states12. Similarly, Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) launched in 2016 provides free, comprehensive, and quality antenatal care to all pregnant women in their 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy13. The performance of these schemes is measured by the utilization of antenatal care (ANC), institutional delivery (ID), and post-natal care (PNC) service components14. The uptake of these services has increased over the last few years; compared to 2015-16, ANC (51.2%), ID (78.9%) and PNC (62.4%) have increased to 58.1%, 88.6% and 78%, respectively, in 2019\u20132115,16. However, an increase in the utilization of these services alone does not translate to availing of the continuum of maternal care by all beneficiaries therefore, all pregnant women must complete CoC in terms of maternal health services utilization to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.\n\nGlobally, CoC in terms of maternal health services has been highlighted as one of the vital strategies to reduce maternal and child mortalities. It refers to a pathway that spans from pregnancy and childbirth to post-pregnancy, covering routine ANC, ID, and PNC services15. CoC in terms of maternal health services emphasizes two key dimensions - time and place (also known as space). The time dimension creates a natural link along the pathway (pregnancy, childbirth, and post-pregnancy). Each stage of the pathway is associated with a service such as ANC, ID, and PNC, ensuring CoC for both the mother and the child16. The place dimension indicates a seamless CoC for maternal health care spanning from home to community, to the health facility, and finally to the hospital from pre-pregnancy to the post-delivery stage and beyond16. Studies show 80% of maternal deaths and 66% of neonatal deaths could be avoided if an effective continuum of maternal care is provided17,18,19.\n\nGiven the background, the current study aims to investigate the distribution, trends, dropouts, and determinants of maternal health services (full ANC, ID, PNC) utilization along the CoC pathway by analyzing India\u2019s National Family and Health Survey (NFHS- 4 and 5) data from 2015 to 2021. The current study used a narrower definition of CoC for maternal health service utilization, focusing on a minimum of four ANC visits (termed as full ANC in this study); childbirth at a health facility (terms as ID); and at least one PNC within 48 hours of delivery. This definition was drawn from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Government of India\u2019s recommendations20,21. A better understanding of CoC pathways in terms of maternal health services utilization will assist in effective evidenced-based planning and optimal utilization of maternal schemes for MMR reduction in India.\n\nConceptual framework\n\nThe framework developed in this study is guided by Andersen\u2019s behavior model (ABM) \u2212 1960 (ABM)22. It explains that the use of maternal health services (i.e., full ANC, ID, and PNC) along CoC pathway is influenced by three important functions. They are: the pre-disposing characteristics; enabling resources; and the need for care. The predisposing characteristics refer to the demographics (biological imperatives like age, gender, and parity); social structure (such as education that determines the status of pregnant women); and health beliefs including the attitude, values, and knowledge of the pregnant women about health/health services that might influence the use22. The enabling resources refer to both personal or community/or organizational level resources that either facilitate or inhibit the use of health services22. Finally, the need to use maternal health services is determined by both perceived and evaluated need22. The perceived need arises from an individual\u2019s view of general health and functional state, whereas the evaluated need is primarily biological and assessed by a healthcare provider. In this study, the need to use maternal health services was limited to perceived need, indicating the perceived severity of pregnant women\u2019s condition to seek maternal health services.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the ABM model is extensively referenced in public health, particularly health services research including research on maternal health services utilization23. Besides, the model is flexible, provides a robust analytical understanding of maternal health services use, and has been applied in different settings and contexts24. Given these strengths, we adapted this model to understand the factors that influence the utilization of maternal health services along the CoC pathway in the Indian context. The model under its three key functions (pre-disposing characteristics, enabling resources, and need to use) also guided the research in identifying and categorizing the study variables (Fig. 1).",

      "content": "Air pollution in India linked to millions of deaths Carly Stearnbourne Hide caption Show caption Credit: Adobe Stock Image\n\nJump to Section Share Post LinkedIn\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nCopy link\n\nA new study published today in Lancet Planetary Health found that long-term exposure to air pollution increased deaths by 1.5 million deaths per year in India, when compared to conditions if India met the World Health Organization\u2019s recommendations for safe exposure.\n\nAir pollution consisting of particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, PM2.5, can enter the lungs and bloodstream and is a major health risk in India. Researchers have now examined the link between these particles and mortality over a ten-year period (2009-2019). Unlike previous studies, this study was across all of India and used a new model of PM2.5 for every 1x1km of the country.\n\n(A) Annual mean concentrations of PM 2\u00b75 in 2009. (B) Differences in annual concentrations in 2014 compared with 2009. (C) Differences in annual concentrations in 2019 compared with 2009. Lancet.\n\n\u201cWe found that every 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in PM2.5 concentration led to an 8.6 percent increase in mortality,\u201d said co-author Joel Schwartz, PhD, faculty member in the Department of Environmental Health at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cThe increase was even larger for 10 microgram per cubic meter increases in PM2.5 from levels below the Indian guidelines of 40 micrograms per cubic meter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe results show that current guidelines in India are not sufficient to protect health. Stricter regulations and measures to reduce emissions are of utmost importance,\u201d said co-author Petter Ljungman of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden.\n\n\u201cDelhi may get the headlines, but this is a problem all over India, and nationwide efforts are needed. Coal burning electric plants need scrubbers, crop burning needs to be limited, and most importantly, the government needs to recognize this as a major issue,\u201d said Dr. Schwartz.\n\nThe study also highlights that the entire population of India lives in areas where PM2.5 levels exceed WHO guidelines. Hence 1.4 billion people are exposed year after year to air pollution that can negatively affect health. In some regions, levels of up to 119 micrograms per cubic meter were measured, significantly higher than what both the WHO and India consider safe.\n\nThe study is a collaboration between researchers from universities in India, Sweden, USA, Israel and Italy.\n\nPublication: \u2018Estimating the effect of annual PM2-5 exposure on mortality in India: a difference-in-differences approach\u2019, Suganthi Jaganathan, Massimo Stafoggia, Ajit Rajiva, Siddhartha Mandal, Shweta Dixit, Jeroen de Bont, Gregory A Wellenius, Kevin J Lane, Amruta Nori-Sarma, Itai Kloog, Dorairaj Prabhakaran, Poornima Prabhakaran, Joel Schwartz, Petter Ljungman, The Lancet Planetary Health, Published December 2024.

      "content": "(In the weekly Health Matters newsletter, wewrite about getting to good health, and staying there. You can subscribe here to get the newsletter in your inbox.)\n\nEvery year, public health activists look forward to the Union Budget, hoping for increased allocations for the health sector, a boost for primary health, a focus on prevention to help keep the population healthy and the strengthening of State-run healthcare institutions. And nearly every year, there is disappointment: once again this year, India will not be spending even 2.5% of the GDP on health. The Budget allocation this year, is \u20b999,858.56 crore for health, an almost 10% increase over the previous financial year, but, adjusted for inflation, the increase is negligible.\n\nWhile there are several welcome health-related schemes that have been announced, including health cover for gig workers under the Centre\u2019s flagship Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), exempting 36 life-saving drugs from custom duties, the addition of 75,000 undergraduate medical seats over the next five years and the setting up of daycare cancer centres at all district hospitals, an approach towards transformative health reforms that would substantially help decrease out-of-pocket expenditure on health and increase public use of government facilities, is missing.\n\nOur experts break this down for you: Priyadarshini Singh points out that the National Health Mission, a government programme that covers urban and rural health, has had only a meagre 3.4% increase in allocations from 2024 (RE). Dr.J. Amalorpavanathan says more doctors (from more medical seats) does not automatically mean better public health. Unless the government plans to absorb a substantial number of doctors into public health \u2014 and there is no such indication \u2014 this will only help the private sector with a steady supply of cheap labour. ProfK. Srinath Reddy emphasises that overall, the Budget focuses more on delivering curative care than on health promotion and disease prevention. Christianez Ratna Kiruba and Kinshuk Gupta ask why there was no mention of disability in the Budget.\n\nFor a quick visual glimpse of what the Budget offers in health, do watch Bindu Shajan Perappadan\u2019s video summary here.\n\nMoving on to other health-related news from the week, the World Health Organization has recommended the use of lower sodium salt substitutes, to reduce sodium intake to less than 2 g a day. Why is salt important, and why has salt again become a vehicle to bring about sweeping public health behaviour change? Ramya Kannan has the answers here. How we eat has become increasingly important today -- and if you need any convincing on that front, do read this analysis that found one in every two people in the country had a lifestyle disorder.

A waiver for life-saving humanitarian assistance was subsequently issued, but the suspension could have devastating consequences for millions battling health conditions, as an open letter written to Mr. Trump by TB-affected communities from around the world says.

      "content": "Poll What Will Be the Biggest Impact of USAID's Suspension of Work in India? Setback for Education, Gender, and Climate Change Initiatives Disruption of Health-Related Programs and Services\n\nNEW DELHI: Following the issuance of an executive order by President Donald Trump to review US foreign assistance and align them with the policies of the new administration, US Agency for International Development (USAID) has issued a directive asking all organisations implementing projects with its support in India to suspend work until further notice. The move has raised concerns among those engaged with USAID-funded projects in India.The biggest impact is expected on health-related programmes where USAID funds have been seen to have bolstered technical support to grassroots-level outreach. Other sectors where impacts going forward are likely to be felt include education, gender and climate change. Though USAID has a small footprint in India, the prospect of its engagement shrinking further comes at a time when global aid has considerably dropped, and can compound the financial troubles facing NGOs in development.USAID's directive to partners including voluntary organisations and agencies steering projects for govts, make it clear that they must minimise expenditure on the collaborations during the pause period. \"The recipient shall not resume work under this agreement until notification has been received in writing from the Agreement Officer (USAID) that this award suspension has been cancelled,\" the directive states. It is learnt from sources in the development sector that the 'stop work' orders come with the caveat of a 90-day period during which the existing grants will be reviewed.\"But the uncertainty is causing panic,\" a development practitioner said on conditions of anonymity while asserting that her organisation is able to continue work as there are other donors.According to the USAID website, as of Jan 2021, the agency was supporting mother and child health initiatives in six states with a focus on improving maternal and child health services. It was also funding initiatives to improve health by advancing access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene in several cities, and in addition to this, partnered with states and private agencies to support programmes preventing gender-based violence and protecting and supporting the disabled population.According to development sector professionals, the civil society has already been feeling the heat of a funds crunch with sources of global aid slowly drying up over the decades. Moreover, the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act restrictions in recent years have made it harder for local organisations to get foreign donations.Harsh Jaitli, CEO of Voluntary Action Network India, which is a network of 600 civil society organisations, said USAID pause on funding is part of a larger global trend with big agencies from Sweden, Germany and UK cutting down on aid to countries.However, smaller civil society organisations working at the grassroots level largely remain unimpacted by the USAID directive as the agency support is largely seen in big programmes like combating tuberculosis and outreach on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). According to those working in the sector, since 2004, USAID has been largely supporting technical work on the projects steered by govts.",

      "title": "Time series forecasting of bed occupancy in mental health facilities in India using machine learning",
      "content": "The analysis of weekly bed occupancy data reveals significant variability and skewness, with most weeks showing moderate-to-high occupancy levels but occasional sharp declines. The stationarity of the time series, confirmed by both the ADF and KPSS tests, suggests that bed occupancy patterns remain consistent over time (refer Table 1 and Fig. 2). However, the data does not follow a normal distribution, as indicated by the Shapiro\u2013Wilk and Jarque\u2013Bera tests, highlighting the presence of extreme values. These findings underscore the complex and non-linear nature of bed occupancy trends in mental health hospitals, likely driven by fluctuating patient admissions and discharges. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for effective resource planning and management in healthcare facilities. The statistical decomposition of the bed occupancy data offers meaningful insights for hospital management as explained in Fig. 4 shows that the trend component suggests that over time, the hospital\u2019s bed usage follows a predictable pattern, with periods of increased and decreased occupancy. This understanding of the trend can help hospital administrators plan for long-term resource allocation and ensure that staffing and infrastructure are aligned with expected changes in demand.\n\nThe seasonal component reveals that mental health hospital bed occupancy exhibits cyclical variation throughout the year. These seasonal fluctuations may correspond to factors like seasonal affective disorders, changing weather conditions, or variations in patient admissions. Recognizing these seasonal patterns allows hospital management to anticipate periods of higher or lower occupancy and adjust staffing levels, resource allocation, and bed availability accordingly. The residual component, which represents the deviations from the trend and seasonal patterns, highlights periods where bed occupancy behaved unpredictably. These residual fluctuations could be linked to sudden spikes in patient admissions due to crises, outbreaks, or other irregular events. Monitoring these residuals can help hospitals identify and respond to unexpected demand surges, ensuring that patient care is not compromised.\n\nThe weekly and monthly trends (see, Fig. 6) and Figure (ref Fig. 5) in bed occupancy emphasize the influence of external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as seen in the peak during 2020. Mental health services faced increased pressure during this period, with a sharp rise in hospitalizations. Seasonal patterns are also observed, with certain weeks in the mid-year period (Weeks 21\u201331 or June- August month) consistently exhibiting higher occupancy across multiple years. These trends suggest that hospital admissions are not only affected by unforeseen crises but also by seasonal factors, possibly related to external environmental, economic, or social influences. Understanding these weekly and monthly fluctuations is critical for healthcare administrators in mental health hospitals to plan resources effectively and ensure optimal capacity management, especially during predictable peak periods.\n\nThe feature selection process in this study focused on identifying variables that significantly influence weekly bed occupancy patterns. By analyzing historical data trends and patterns, we selected lagged occupancy values as primary predictors. This selection was guided by statistical techniques such as autocorrelation analysis and Partial Autocorrelation Functions (PACF), which highlighted obtaining 52-weeks lags for bed occupancy forecasting. These approaches ensured that the chosen features were both interpretable and strongly correlated with the target variable, contributing to the overall model performance.While the current model predominantly utilizes historical occupancy data, the inclusion of exogenous factors such as demographic information (e.g., age distribution, gender ratios) and socio-economic indicators (e.g., income levels, unemployment rates) could enhance forecasting accuracy. These factors often influence patient admissions and hospital resource utilization. For instance:Demographic data could help identify trends in hospital visits based on age groups more susceptible to mental health issues. Socioeconomic indicators might reveal correlations between economic stressors and mental health admissions, especially during periods of financial instability or crises.\n\nThe optimal hyperparameter selection for each machine learning model was crucial in achieving accurate forecasting results (as shown in Table 2). In machine learning, hyperparameter tuning is vital to avoid overfitting and underfitting, ensuring the model can generalize well to unseen data. For each model, we conducted an extensive grid search to explore the most plausible hyperparameter combinations: SVR with 36 combinations, XGBoost with 162, Random Forest with 162, KNN with 162, Gradient Boosting with 54, and Decision Tree with 27 combinations. From these trials, we identified the optimal hyperparameter combination for each model, which allowed us to fine-tune their performance for the complex weekly bed occupancy time series data.\n\nThe SVR model, using a higher regularization parameter C=10 and a wider epsilon margin 0.5, was fine-tuned to handle the inherent variability in bed occupancy. In the case of XGBoost, the choice of a lower max_depth (5) and moderate learning rate (0.2) ensured that the model captured patterns without overfitting. Random Forest benefitted from a deeper tree structure (max_depth=15) and the use of a higher number of trees, allowing it to generalize well over time series data. KNN\u2019s use of weights=\u2019distance\u2019 ensured more reliable predictions by prioritizing nearby neighbors. Gradient Boosting, with its optimal combination of n_estimators=100 and max_depth=5, delivered strong results, balancing complexity and generalization. Lastly, the Decision Tree model, with max_depth=5, exhibited strong performance with fewer splits and leaves, avoiding overfitting. These optimal hyperparameter selections underscore the importance of model tuning, particularly in the context of time series forecasting, where the complexity and dynamics of the data require careful balancing between model flexibility and generalization capacity34,37.\n\nFrom these visualizations i.e. Fig. 7, it is evident that ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are the most effective at capturing the nuances in weekly bed occupancy patterns. Both models exhibit low residuals between the actual and fitted values, indicating a strong capacity for modeling complex, non-linear relationships. These models are well-suited for forecasting in healthcare settings, where bed occupancy can vary dramatically due to external factors such as seasonal fluctuations or changes in patient intake policies. XGBoost also demonstrates strong performance, capturing both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations, making it a viable alternative. In contrast, KNN and SVR show weaker performance in fitting the training data, particularly in handling the extremes of bed occupancy. While SVR provides smoother predictions, it sacrifices accuracy in capturing variability, and KNN\u2019s reliance on local proximity leads to significant deviations during periods of rapid change. These models may not be as reliable for resource management in a mental health hospital setting, where accurate forecasts are critical for operational planning and patient care. This highlights the importance of choosing robust models that can handle both the trend and variability of the data, ensuring optimal management of healthcare resources for predicting on test data.\n\nFrom the test data predictions, as visualized in Fig. 8, it is evident that Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) are the top-performing models for forecasting weekly bed occupancy in the mental health hospital. Both models demonstrate strong predictive capabilities, as they closely follow the actual test data patterns. The statistical metrics further support this observation.\n\nIn terms of performance on the test data, Random Forest achieves the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 22.99, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 16.18, and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 3.57%, which highlights its ability to accurately predict future occupancy with minimal deviation from the actual data. Random Forest\u2019s ensemble approach, which averages predictions across multiple decision trees, enhances its ability to generalize, reducing overfitting and allowing it to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in bed occupancy (refer Table 3). Decision Tree, while a simpler model compared to Random Forest, also performs admirably, with an RMSE of 24.33, MAE of 17.25, and MAPE of 3.87%. These metrics indicate that Decision Tree can capture the essential patterns in the data, though it occasionally exhibits slightly higher errors than Random Forest. However, Decision Tree remains robust in its ability to model occupancy dynamics, making it a reliable alternative for forecasting in similar contexts.\n\nWhile Random Forest and Decision Tree outperform other models, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost also show competitive performance. Gradient Boosting achieves a test RMSE of 32.77, MAE of 20.53, and MAPE of 4.42%, whereas XGBoost delivers a slightly lower RMSE of 32.22, MAE of 21.38, and MAPE of 4.63%. These models effectively capture the overall trends in the data but tend to underperform in capturing finer fluctuations, leading to marginally higher error rates compared to Random Forest and Decision Tree.\n\nThe comparative performance of Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB) models highlights trade-offs in computational efficiency and scalability. RF, with its parallel tree construction, is computationally efficient and scales well with larger datasets, as the independence of tree training minimizes processing bottlenecks. In contrast, GB trains trees sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous one. While this sequential nature improves accuracy for smaller to medium-sized datasets, it makes GB computationally intensive and less scalable for large datasets. Techniques like XGBoost partially address this limitation by optimizing the boosting process but still require more computational resources compared to RF.\n\nFor this study, RF demonstrated faster training times and strong scalability, making it ideal for real-time applications and large-scale datasets. In contrast, GB, while slower due to its sequential nature, achieved slightly better accuracy by capturing complex patterns more effectively. These findings highlight the trade-off between efficiency and precision, with RF excelling in computational efficiency and scalability, while GB is better suited for tasks prioritizing predictive accuracy despite higher computational demands.\n\nIn contrast, models like Support Vector Regression (SVR) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) display significantly higher error metrics on the test data. SVR yields an RMSE of 53.03 and a MAPE of 8.51%, indicating that its predictions are less aligned with the actual data, particularly during periods of rapid occupancy changes. Similarly, KNN exhibits the weakest performance, with the highest RMSE of 72.37 and a MAPE of 11.47%, suggesting that it struggles to capture the temporal patterns in the dataset (see, Fig. 9 and Table 3). Given these observations, Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) models are recommended for long-term forecasting as they emerge as the most effective models for forecasting bed occupancy in the mental health hospital. Their ability to generalize well across a range of occupancy levels while maintaining low error rates makes them particularly well-suited for projecting bed needs over an extended period. Hence, greater importance is given to the 52-week bed forecasts generated by these models, as their reliable predictions offer practical value for resource management. Their superior performance makes them ideal candidates for healthcare resource management, providing reliable forecasts that can assist hospital administrators in optimizing bed allocation and planning for patient care.\n\nThe Fig. 10 above illustrates the forecasted bed occupancy for the next 52 weeks (1 year) based on several ML models. The Random Forest forecast (depicted in red) demonstrates an impressive ability to capture trends and fluctuations in bed occupancy over the forecast period. This model consistently tracks the general upward trend in occupancy, while also accounting for periodic dips. Given its strong performance on test data, the Random Forest and Decision Tree (depicted in brown) models are given priority in the 52-week forecasts and offer reliable forecasts that can be used by healthcare administrators to plan for expected increases or decreases in patient admissions, ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to meet future demand.\n\nGradient Boosting and XGBoost, while also performing admirably, show slightly less precision compared to RF and DT. These models capture the general trend well, but they occasionally exhibit minor deviations in their predictions. Despite these small discrepancies, both Gradient Boosting and XGBoost remain strong contenders and can be considered reliable tools for forecasting bed occupancy. Their predictive accuracy makes them suitable for healthcare management, though they should be considered secondary to RF and DT models. On the other hand, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model presents a notably smoother forecast which fails to capture the intricate variations in bed occupancy. Finally, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model proves to be the least effective for long-term planning. Its forecast is erratic and fails to align with the expected trends in bed occupancy. Thus these two models are not recommended for precise forecasting in a dynamic healthcare environment.\n\nThe results of the Diebold\u2013Mariano (DM) test indicate that both the Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) models perform similarly with no statistically significant difference (DM statistic = \\(-0.70\\), p-value = 0.4869), suggesting that either model can be recommended for use in healthcare management, particularly in predicting bed occupancy in mental health hospitals, without any loss in predictive power. Similarly, XGBoost and Gradient Boosting also exhibited comparable performance (DM statistic = \\(-0.50\\), p-value = 0.6178), indicating that these models are equally effective in capturing patterns related to hospital bed occupancy (refer Fig. 11 and Table 4). These models, particularly RF, DT, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting, can be considered reliable for healthcare forecasting tasks, where accurate predictions are essential for resource allocation and management. SVR and KNN, while occasionally outperforming some models, showed statistically significant differences compared to the top performers, making them less ideal for this specific predictive task. However, KNN did outperform SVR in one comparison (DM statistic = \\(-2.26\\), p-value = 0.0254). Overall, RF, DT, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting models provide robust and reliable options for predicting bed occupancy in mental health hospitals, facilitating better planning and management of healthcare resources.\n\nOur study addresses the research gap in forecasting bed occupancy in mental health hospitals using machine learning models, a critical yet underexplored area compared to general hospitals. By leveraging robust statistical evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, we successfully forecast bed occupancy with minimal error rate (3.57%), enabling stakeholders to plan bed allocations effectively. These insights create support base for strategic decision-making in government policies, budget allocation, and infrastructure efficiency, ensuring optimal resource management and enhanced patient care.\n\nRecommended strategy\n\nEffective healthcare management in mental hospitals requires the use of statistically robust predictive models to optimize resource allocation and improve patient care. Based on the results of the Diebold\u2013Mariano (DM) test and overall model performance, Random Forest and Decision Tree are the most reliable models for forecasting bed occupancy. These models demonstrated similar predictive capabilities with no statistically significant difference, making them ideal choices for long-term occupancy planning and resource management. Their ability to generalize across varying occupancy levels while maintaining low error rates ensures accurate forecasts that can help administrators efficiently allocate beds and plan staff and resources. To further enhance the robustness of forecasting, insights from XGBoost and Gradient Boosting should also be considered. These models showed comparable performance to Random Forest and Decision Tree, providing additional validation and a broader perspective for decision-making. Incorporating these ensemble methods as secondary models can help confirm predictions and offer a well-rounded view of future trends. In contrast, KNN and SVR delivered weaker and less stable predictions. As a result, these models should be used with caution, if at all, as their unreliability could lead to suboptimal resource planning and misaligned strategies. In conclusion, healthcare administrators in this mental health hospital should prioritize Random Forest and Decision Tree as primary models for accurate and consistent bed occupancy forecasting, while leveraging XGBoost and Gradient Boosting for additional validation and predictive insight. This comprehensive approach will ensure data-driven, reliable resource management to meet patient care needs efficiently.\n\nOur predictive models offer a promising approach to enhancing real-time hospital management systems, providing practical solutions for improving resource planning and patient care. These models are capable of integrating seamlessly within existing hospital operations, connecting with systems such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and IoT-based monitoring tools to deliver actionable insights. To implement these models effectively, the process can begin with integrating quality, real-time data from EHRs and IoT devices, supported by robust data governance policies. Models are optimized for scalability using cloud computing and efficient algorithms, ensuring they can handle increasing patient volumes. Integration with existing IT systems can be achieved through secure APIs and compliance with healthcare regulations. Stakeholder engagement via training programs and pilot tests builds trust and facilitates smooth adoption. With a focus on accuracy, scalability, and usability, these models empower hospitals to anticipate and manage patient needs while addressing operational challenges efficiently.\n\nAs limitation of our study, we suggest the incorporation of advanced metaheuristic optimization techniques, which may improve predictive accuracy and efficiency, particularly when dealing with a large and complex data set. Transitioning from traditional grid search methods to Bayesian optimization could streamline hyperparameter tuning, leading to faster and more effective model optimization. In addition, the integration of exogenous factors such as demographic data, socioeconomic indicators, and environmental variables can provide a clearer understanding of the influences on the utilization of mental health services, enhancing the precision of prediction.",

      "content": "Improving health in India\n\n\n\nAs the world\u2019s second-most-populous country and one of its fastest-growing economies, India faces both unique challenges and unprecedented opportunities in the sphere of public health.\n\nFor more than a decade, India has experienced record-breaking economic growth that has been accompanied by significant reductions in poverty. According to the World Bank, infant mortality in India fell from 66 to 38 per 1,000 live births from 2000 to 2015. Life expectancy at birth has increased from 63 to 68 years, and the maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 374 to 174 per 100,000 live births over the same period.\n\nIndia also has dynamic pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries; world-class scientists, including a burgeoning clinical trials industry; and leading hospitals that attract foreign patients and treat its better-off citizens.\n\nYet Indian government and public health officials agree that the country also faces persistent and daunting public health challenges, particularly for the poor. These include child undernutrition and low birth weights that often lead to premature death or lifelong health problems; high rates of neonatal and maternal mortality; growth in noncommunicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and tobacco use, leading to cancer and other diseases; and high rates of road traffic accidents that result in injuries and deaths.\n\nAs the Indian government strives to provide comprehensive health coverage for all, the country\u2019s rapidly developing health system remains an area of concern. There are disparities in health and health care systems between poorer and richer states and underfunded health care systems that in many cases are inefficiently run and underregulated. New government-financed health insurance programs are increasing coverage, but insurance remains limited.\n\nPublic and private health systems are placing huge demands on the country\u2019s capacity to train exceptional health leaders and professionals. Rising to meet these challenges, the people of India have an opportunity to have a major influence on their own future health and on the future of public health and medical efforts globally.\n\nSupporting development of India\u2019s health workforce\n\nHarvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health is collaborating with partners across India to address those challenges. Together, the School and its partners are introducing educational innovations to India to expand skills training, degree programs, and leadership development at new schools and institutes of public health. We seek to leverage the School\u2019s resources to help strengthen public health training and build capacity across the health sector in India.",

      "title": "A green signal for India to assert its health leadership",
      "content": "The Union Budget 2025-26 lays a robust foundation for India to assert its leadership in global health care and innovation, with strategic announcements that bolster medical infrastructure, expand educational opportunities, and promote global collaboration.\n\nWith a \u20b990,958 crore health-care allocation, the addition of 75,000 medical seats over the next five years, and investments in daycare cancer centres, India is poised to enhance both accessibility and quality of care. The country will add 10,000 medical seats in FY26 alone, underscoring its commitment to health-care excellence.\n\nIndia\u2019s health-care transformation\n\nThis Budget underscores India\u2019s remarkable journey of progress, from the 1980s when it grappled with limited medical infrastructure, to its current status as a global health-care leader. The transformation has been nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nRecently, the writer had the privilege of presenting two key recommendations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi: first, establishing India as the global health-care destination, and second, addressing the global shortfall of health-care professionals. It has been a delight to see both these ideas in action through the \u2018Heal in India\u2019 and \u2018Heal by India\u2019 initiatives. With streamlined visa processes, enhanced hospital infrastructure, and robust public-private partnerships, India is poised to become the preferred medical destination for international patients.\n\nSimultaneously, the country is addressing the global shortfall of health-care professionals by training and deploying more doctors, nurses, and paramedics abroad. This will ensure that Indian expertise supports health-care systems worldwide while creating new opportunities for our skilled professionals.\n\nCustoms duty exemptions, tech outlook\n\nMoreover, it is commendable that the growing burden of non-communicable diseases such as cancer has been acknowledged in this Budget. The establishment of 200 day-care cancer centres in district hospitals will bring specialised treatment closer to people, improving early diagnosis and better patient outcomes.\n\nThe customs duty exemption on 36 life-saving drugs, including those for cancer, rare diseases, and chronic conditions will lower the cost of treatments, in turn, benefiting thousands of patients across the country. Also, the addition of 13 new patient assistance programmes would also improve access to critical medications for patients, particularly those with chronic conditions.\n\nThe emphasis on Artificial Intelligence and digital health marks a pivotal moment for the future of India\u2019s health care. The new National Centres of Excellence will spearhead innovation in diagnostics, treatment, and research, enabling India to develop cutting-edge solutions that enhance patient care.\n\nThe writer believes that the introduction of cutting-edge technologies to deliver quality health care has strengthened India\u2019s position as a global health-care player. Both private and public hospitals have played an integral role in this progress. Apollo was the first hospital to launch Proton therapy for advanced cancer care in this part of the world and continues to attract patients from countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom to name a few.\n\nBuild on the momentum\n\nThis Budget clearly recognises the government\u2019s vision for \u2014 and demonstration of bold leadership in recognising \u2014 health care as a pillar of national growth and development. From a country that once struggled to provide basic medical care, we have evolved into a nation offering world-class treatment to millions. Through the synergy of Heal in India, Heal by India, and innovation-driven care, we are shaping a future where India\u2019s health-care system sets new global benchmarks.\n\nIt is our collective responsibility now to build on this momentum \u2014 by embracing technology, strengthening medical education, and ensuring that health care reaches every individual in need.\n\nIndia is not just healing its own people; it is healing the world.\n\nDr. Prathap C. Reddy is Founder and Chairman, Apollo Hospitals",

      "title": "Impact of pandemic-related worries on mental health in India from 2020 to 2022",
      "content": "Descriptive statistics\n\nTable 1 presents a summary of both unweighted and weighted statistics for the variables within the full sample (N = 2,576,174 respondents aged \u226518 years in India). Regarding mental health outcomes, the weighted proportions of respondents experiencing feelings of depression and anxiety were 8% and 6%, respectively, in both periods. In terms of subjective worries, in Period 1, 21% of the respondents post-weighted reported financial stress, 8% reported food insecurity, and 24% reported COVID-19-related illness concerns. Period 2 showed similar weighted statistics (17% for financial stress; 8% for food insecurity), except that COVID-19-related illness concerns were discontinued from the survey at this time. Notably, the demographics of the CTIS respondents, even after applying weights (considering age and gender), did not align accurately with the general Indian adult population. Specifically, the weighted sample had a larger proportion of males (66% in Period 1 and 57% in Period 2, as opposed to 52% in the census), people aged between 25 and 34 years (37% in Period 1 and 31% in Period 2, compared to 27% in the census), people having education levels of at least high school (83% in Period 1 and 93% in Period 2, as opposed to 27% in the census), and people residing in urban areas (75% in Period 1 and 75% in Period 2, compared to 31% in the census).\n\nTable 1 Summary of unweighted and weighted statistics for demographics, worries about the pandemic, and mental health in the full sample (N = 2,576,174) Full size table\n\nWe analyzed the unadjusted correlations between the outcomes and primary exposures using the full sample (N = 2,576,174) and the complete Likert scales (5-point scale for depression and anxiety, and 4-point scale for worry variables), without applying weights. For the outcomes, the responses for depression and anxiety were moderately correlated, with Kendall rank correlation coefficients of 0.59 in Period 1 and 0.58 in Period 2 (Supplementary Table 2). For the exposures, financial stress and food insecurity were moderately correlated, while both were weakly correlated with COVID-19-related illness concerns. For instance, the Kendall rank correlation between financial stress and food insecurity was 0.55 in Period 1, compared to 0.25 between financial stress and COVID-19-related illness concerns (Supplementary Table 2). Additionally, depression and anxiety showed weak correlations with pandemic-related worries. For example, the Kendall rank correlation between depression and financial stress was 0.20 in Period 1 and 0.24 in Period 2 (Supplementary Table 2). Similar patterns were observed with Pearson correlation coefficients (Supplementary Table 2). Pearson correlation coefficients showed upward inflation compared to Kendall rank correlation coefficients as expected.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the weekly weighted prevalence of depression and anxiety from June 27, 2020, to June 25, 2022, using the full sample (N = 2,576,174). The vertical dashed line marks the time of the major change in the survey structure. Notably, there were three peaks in both the weekly new cases and deaths during the study period, occurring approximately in September 2020, May 2021, and January 2022. During the second wave in May 2021, there was a noticeable increase in the prevalence of self-reported depression (10.11%) and to some extent for anxiety (7.61%), compared to January 2021 (7.58% for depression and 5.80% for anxiety). This shows a concurrent worsening in self-reported mental health outcomes during the peak of the second COVID-19 wave. However, this pattern was not as prominent during the first and third waves. When comparing the weighted proportions of individuals experiencing depression and anxiety at the start and end of the study period, the values in 2022 (8.29% for depression and 6.17% for anxiety) were higher than those observed in 2020 (7.24% for depression and 4.77% for anxiety). This underscores the enduring impact of the pandemic-related concerns on mental health within the Indian population.\n\nFig. 1: Weekly proportions of depression and anxiety, post-weighting, alongside the weekly total of new COVID-19 confirmed cases and new COVID-19-related deaths, from June 27, 2020, to June 25, 2022 (N = 2,576,174). The full sample was used to calculate the proportions of mental health outcomes. Facebook-provided weights were applied to account for non-response and coverage bias. A 7-day smoothing method was used to calculate the weighted averages. COVID-19 case and death data were sourced from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. A vertical dashed line marks the major survey structure change on May 20, 2021. Full size image\n\nOur gender-stratified analysis revealed notable distinctions in the weighted proportions. Regarding self-reported mental health problems, females showed a higher prevalence of depression than males in both Period 1 (10% vs. 6%) and Period 2 (9% vs. 8%), as well as increased anxiety in Period 1 (7% vs. 5%). Regarding the worry variables, males reported greater concerns about their financial situation (23% vs. 18% in Period 1; 19% vs. 14% in Period 2) and food status (9% vs. 6% in Period 1; 9% vs. 5% in Period 2) compared to females.\n\nLikewise, we examined urban\u2013rural differences in weighted proportions. In Period 1, the incidence of self-reported depression and anxiety among rural residents mirrored that of urban dwellers (8% vs. 8% for depression and 5% vs. 5% for anxiety), whereas Period 2 saw a higher occurrence in rural areas (9% vs. 8% for depression and 7% vs. 5% for anxiety). Concerning pandemic-related worries, rural individuals consistently reported greater levels of financial stress (28% vs. 19% in Period 1; 25% vs. 15% in Period 2) and food insecurity (12% vs. 7% in Period 1; 13% vs. 6% in Period 2) compared to urban residents.\n\nAssociations between worry variables and mental health outcomes\n\nTable 2 displays the odds ratios for worry variables (considered as exposures) obtained from weighted logistic regression analyses. The analysis was based on complete cases from two distinct periods: Period 1 (N = 595,229) and Period 2 (N = 152,767). Here, we first report results from the fully adjusted models that concurrently incorporated all worry variables and other covariates, namely demographic factors and calendar time. The results from the fully adjusted models in Period 1 indicate significant associations between all three subjective worries (financial stress, food insecurity, and COVID-19-related illness worries) and mental health problems (both depression and anxiety). Notably, financial stress emerged as the most influential factor among the three worries. In particular, the odds of experiencing depression and anxiety were 2.36 (95% confidence interval, CI: [2.27, 2.46]) and 1.91 (95% CI: [1.81, 2.01]) times higher for those concerned about their financial situation compared to those without such worries, after adjusting for other variables, respectively. Individuals reporting food insecurity had higher adjusted odds for depression (odds ratio: 1.45, 95% CI: [1.38, 1.53]) and anxiety (odds ratio: 1.56, 95% CI: [1.47, 1.66]) compared to those without this concern. Similarly, the adjusted odds ratios regarding COVID-19-related illness worries were 1.65 (95% CI: [1.59, 1.71]) for depression and 1.81 (95% CI: [1.73, 1.90]) for anxiety.\n\nTable 2 Unadjusted, partially adjusted, and fully adjusted model results for depression and anxiety in Period 1 (N = 595,229) and Period 2 (N = 152,767) Full size table\n\nAs depicted in the second part of Table 2, both financial stress and food insecurity had significant associations with mental health problems in the fully adjusted models in Period 2, mirroring findings from Period 1. Particularly, after accounting for all other variables, individuals experiencing financial stress had higher odds of feeling depressed (odds ratio: 2.52, 95% CI: [2.30, 2.77]) and anxious (odds ratio: 1.91, 95% CI: [1.70, 2.15]) compared to those without financial stress. Likewise, individuals reporting concerns about food insecurity exhibited significantly elevated adjusted odds of experiencing depression (odds ratio: 2.32, 95% CI: [2.07, 2.60]) and anxiety (odds ratio: 2.71, 95% CI: [2.31, 3.11]) compared to those without this concern.\n\nIn addition to the fully adjusted models, Table 2 presents outcomes from two other model types for each worry variable: unadjusted models, which only include a single exposure, and partially adjusted models, which include one exposure at a time together with demographic factors and calendar time. The comparisons across the three models for both periods highlight differences in the results. Notably, the odds ratios for all worry variables, consistently significant across models, were higher in the unadjusted models for both depression and anxiety. These values diminished in the partially adjusted models and were further reduced in the fully adjusted models. Taking financial stress as an example, in Period 1, individuals reporting financial stress had a 3.45 (95% CI: [3.34, 3.57]) times higher odds of experiencing depression compared to those without such worries, as indicated by the unadjusted model. This odds ratio decreased to 3.03 (95% CI: [2.93, 3.14]) with adjustments for demographics and calendar time, and further dropped to 2.36 (95% CI: [2.27, 2.46]) with additional adjustments for food insecurity and concerns about COVID-19-related illness. The ranking of the worry variables by their odds ratios also varied depending on whether adjustments were made, even within the same period and for the same outcome. For instance, in the first period, food insecurity showed the highest odds ratios for experiencing anxiety in both unadjusted (odds ratio: 3.29, 95% CI: [3.14, 3.45]) and partially adjusted models (odds ratio: 2.98, 95% CI: [2.83, 3.13]). Yet, in the fully adjusted models, the odds ratio for food insecurity (odds ratio: 1.56, 95% CI: [1.47, 1.66]) was lower than that for financial stress (odds ratio: 1.91, 95% CI: [1.81, 2.01]).\n\nAssociations between other demographics covariates and mental health outcomes\n\nSupplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4 present odds ratios of other covariates derived from weighted logistic regression models for both unadjusted models, featuring a single covariate, and fully adjusted versions that incorporate a complete set of relevant covariates, including the collective inclusion of all three worry variables. In Period 1, the analysis of fully adjusted models, as presented in Supplementary Table 3, revealed significant relationships between demographic factors\u2014such as gender, age, urban\u2013rural residential status, geographical region, and occupation\u2014and the prevalence of depression or anxiety. Key findings indicate that factors associated with poorer mental health outcomes include being female, being in the young adult age group, residing in urban areas, hailing from the southern regions, and engaging in occupations outside the agricultural sector. Notably, after controlling for other variables, individuals employed in the education sector had 1.23 (95% CI: [1.14, 1.34]) and 1.30 (95% CI: [1.18, 1.43]) times higher odds of reporting depression and anxiety, respectively, compared to those in agriculture. Similarly, those working in the tourism industry faced 1.55 (95% CI: [1.36, 1.77]) and 1.46 (95% CI: [1.24, 1.71]) times higher odds of experiencing depression and anxiety, respectively, in comparison to agricultural workers.\n\nIn Period 2, the influence of demographic variables on depression and anxiety mirrored the results observed in Period 1, with significant associations identified for gender, age, residential status, geographic region, and occupation after adjusting for other factors (Supplementary Table 4). This period also highlighted the significance of education, a factor not previously noted in Period 1. Notably, the fully adjusted models showed that individuals without a high school diploma had a 1.24 (95% CI: [1.11, 1.39]) and 1.17 (95% CI: [1.04, 1.32]) times higher odds of experiencing depression and anxiety, respectively, compared to individuals with at least a high school education.\n\nEffect modification by gender on the associations between worry variables and mental health outcomes\n\nOur analysis explored potential modification of the associations between three pandemic-related worries on depression and anxiety by self-reported gender, by adding an interaction term between gender and each of the worry variables separately into our fully adjusted survey-weighted model. Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 5 illustrate the odds ratios for depression and anxiety across different worry variables within each gender, after adjusting for other worries, demographic factors, and calendar time. Throughout both periods, every pandemic-related worry variable demonstrated a significant association with mental health problems in both genders from the fully adjusted survey-weighted models. In Period 1, females had a significantly lower odds ratio of reporting depression and anxiety compared to males regarding the same concern (P int <0.01, where P int denotes the P value corresponding to the gender by worry interaction term in the fully adjusted model). Specifically, in terms of concerns about financial status, the odds ratios for feeling depressed and anxious were 2.03 (95% CI: [1.88, 2.19]) and 1.74 (95% CI: [1.58, 1.91]) for females, respectively, lower than the corresponding odds ratios for males, which were 2.59 (95% CI: [2.49, 2.70]) and 2.02 (95% CI: [1.92, 2.12]). Similarly, the odds ratios regarding food insecurity for depression and anxiety were 1.21 (95% CI: [1.07, 1.36]) and 1.32 (95% CI: [1.16, 1.51]) for females, respectively, again lower than those for males, who showed odds ratios of 1.56 (95% CI: [1.49, 1.64]) for depression and 1.67 (95% CI: [1.57, 1.77]) for anxiety. In Period 2, the smaller sample size resulted in wider confidence intervals, leading to no statistically significant gender differences in the odds ratios for the worry variables (for depression, P int = 0.17 in finance stress and P int = 0.43 in food insecurity; for anxiety, P int = 0.34 in finance stress and P int = 0.70 in food insecurity), despite varying point estimates.\n\nFig. 2: Effects of worry variables on mental health between genders in Period 1 (N = 595,229) and Period 2 (N = 152,767), post-weighting. Due to the significant survey structure change on May 20, 2021, the analysis was split into two periods: Period 1 (June 27, 2020, to May 19, 2021) and Period 2 (May 20, 2021, to June 25, 2022). Complete cases from each period were analyzed using separate fully adjusted models that included pandemic-related worries (financial stress, food insecurity, and COVID-19-related illness concerns), demographics (gender, age, education, urban\u2013rural residential status, region, and occupation), and calendar time (categorized by month and year), with each model also adding an additional interaction term between gender and one of worry variables. Presented are odds ratios and their corresponding 95% Wald confidence intervals. Significant interaction terms (P int ) from Wald tests (significance level: 0.05) are highlighted in red. All models integrate survey weights within the logistic regression. Robust sandwich estimators were used for variance calculation. The vertical dashed line denotes the odds ratio of 1. Full size image\n\nEffect modification by urban\u2013rural residential status on the associations between worry variables and mental health outcomes\n\nWe also examined how urban and rural residents were differently affected by three specific pandemic-related worries in terms of self-reported depression and anxiety. We added an interaction term for residential status and each worry variable separately into the fully adjusted model, accounting for survey weights. Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 6 display the odds ratios for depression and anxiety associated with each worry variable within urban and rural settings, after controlling for other worries, demographic factors, and calendar time. Consistently, across both urban and rural contexts, each worry variable was significantly linked to mental health challenges. In Period 1, urban dwellers exhibited greater odds ratios of experiencing depression and anxiety regarding all of the three COVID-19-related worries than rural residents, with statistically significant interaction terms (P int <0.01) observed in all models. For instance, in terms of financial stress, urban individuals showed odds ratios of 2.44 (95% CI: [2.33, 2.56]) for depression and 1.98 (95% CI: [1.87, 2.09]) for anxiety, surpassing the odds ratios for rural residents, which stood at 2.12 (95% CI: [1.98, 2.26]) and 1.71 (95% CI: [1.58, 1.86]), respectively. In Period 2, urban residents continued to report significantly higher odds of depression and anxiety regarding these worries when compared to rural residents (for depression, P int <0.01 in finance stress; for anxiety, P int <0.01 in finance stress and P int = 0.03 in food insecurity) expect the case with food insecurity for depression (P int = 0.31). For example, in terms of worries about the financial situation, the odds ratios for urban individuals were 2.80 (95% CI: [2.52, 3.12]) for depression and 2.19 (95% CI: [1.92, 2.50]) for anxiety, which were higher than those for rural individuals, with odds ratios of 1.98 (95% CI: [1.73, 2.26]) for depression and 1.41 (95% CI: [1.20, 1.66]) for anxiety).\n\nFig. 3: Effects of worry variables on mental health between urban and rural residential status in Period 1 (N = 595,229) and Period 2 (N = 152,767), post-weighting. Due to the significant survey structure change on May 20, 2021, the analysis was split into two periods: Period 1 (June 27, 2020, to May 19, 2021) and Period 2 (May 20, 2021, to June 25, 2022). Complete cases from each period were analyzed using separate fully adjusted models that included pandemic-related worries (financial stress, food insecurity, and COVID-19-related illness concerns), demographics (gender, age, education, urban\u2013rural residential status, region, and occupation), and calendar time (categorized by month and year), with each model also adding an additional interaction term between residential status and one of worry variables. Presented are odds ratios and their corresponding 95% Wald confidence intervals. Significant interaction terms (P int ) from Wald tests (significance level: 0.05) are highlighted in red. All models integrate survey weights within the logistic regression. Robust sandwich estimators were used for variance calculation. The vertical dashed line denotes the odds ratio of 1. Full size image\n\nTemporal variation in the associations between worry variables and mental health outcomes\n\nWe further delved into how the impact of the three subjective worries on depression and anxiety evolved over time by introducing interaction terms for time (categorized by month and year) with each worry variable individually into our fully adjusted survey-weighted models. Figure 4 presents the adjusted odds ratios for financial stress, food insecurity, and COVID-19-related concerns in relation to feeling depressed and anxious across time, in both periods. Vertical dashed lines represent the timing of the three peaks in newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-related deaths (September 2020, May 2021, and January 2022). During Period 1, financial stress emerged as the most influential factor affecting both depression (the range of odds ratios: [2.02, 2.71]) and anxiety (the range of odds ratios: [1.59, 2.19]), after adjusting for other variables. Although no discernible temporal patterns were evident for financial stress and food insecurity, there was a notable upswing in the odds ratios regarding COVID-19-related health concerns of reporting depression (odds ratio: 2.13, 95% CI: [1.90, 2.39]) and anxiety (odds ratio: 2.25, 95% CI: [1.98, 2.56]) during the second wave in May 2021 compared to the previous month (odds ratio 1.62, 95% CI: [1.46, 1.80] for depression and odds ratio: 1.73, 95% CI: [1.54, 1.94] for anxiety). During Period 2, the interpretation of time trends is constrained due to the smaller sample size, resulting in wider confidence intervals compared to Period 1. For anxiety, the point estimates for the effects of food insecurity (the range of adjusted odds ratios: [2.34, 3.75]) consistently surpassed those for financial stress (the range of adjusted odds ratios: [1.60, 2.43]) over time, while no significant differences were observed between these two sources of worry concerning depression.",

      "content": "Myth: Cervical cancer is hereditary\n\nMyth : HPV infection means cervical cancer\n\nMyth : HPV in not common\n\nMyth : HPV infection can be treated with medicines\n\nMyth : Cervical cancer always has symptoms\n\nMyth : Pap smears are painful\n\nMyth : Cervical cancer can happen only to those who have multiple sexual partners\n\nMyth : Pap smears must be done every year\n\nMyth :HPV infection is unavoidable\n\nDr. Neha Abhijit Pawar, Consultant, Gynaecology, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai\n\nCervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus. It is primarily caused by persistent infection with high-risk strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV). Early stages often have no symptoms, but advanced cases may cause abnormal bleeding, pelvic pain, or discomfort during intercourse. Regular Pap smears and HPV vaccinations significantly reduce the risk by detecting precancerous changes early. Treatment options include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and practicing safe sex can also help prevent cervical cancer. Early detection is key to improving survival rates and successful treatment.Here are a few myths that needs to be addressed.Unlike Breast and Ovarian cancer, cancer of the cervix is not hereditary.It is caused by persistence of a sexually transmitted viral infection called Human. Papilloma Virus (HPV) many years after being exposed.HPV infection by no means is the same as cervical cancer. In most cases, the infection clears up with no future risk. It\u2019s only in a small subset of patients that it can persist and slowly cause changes of pre cancer and cancer over many years.HPV is a sexually transmitted (STI) viral infection which is very commonly contracted by sexually active women. It comes in 2 variants: Low Risk which is linked to genital warts, and high risk which is linked to cervical cancer.Having multiple sexual partners, smoking, poor immunity, increase your chances of contracting the infection.There is no medical treatment to help clear an HPV infection. Once contracted, the virus can remain latent for many years and eventually cause cancer cervix. Fortunately, majority of the patients clear it up by developing a natural immunity to the virus in 2 years. Quitting smoking and adopting healthy lifestyle changes can help your immunity clear it up faster. You can however, an immunity prior to exposure by taking the HPV Vaccine .In its early stages, cervical cancer may not cause any symptoms. Hence the need for routine pap smears and HPV testing even in women who do not have any symptoms to identify the disease in its Precancerous stage when it is completely curable with conservative approaches.Pap smear is a simple and quick screening test which may cause slight discomfort for a few seconds, but is generally not painful.HPV is a very ubiquitous viral infection which can be contracted even by women who have just one sexual partner.Pap smears are recommended in all sexually active women every 3-5 years from Ages 21-65 yrs.Although it is a ubiquitous virus, we can avoid contracting the High Risk HPV infections by taking the HPV Vaccine prior to exposure, ideally before getting sexually active. The vaccine is recommended in 9-11 year old girls and boys, and covers for the most prevalent High risk strains as well as the strains which cause genital warts.Myth : If I\u2019m already sexually active , I cannot take the vaccineAlthough it is recommended in 9-11 year old girls, the vaccine can be taken by women up to the age of 45 years.",

      "content": "The closure of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is likely to have far-reaching consequences for India, with experts warning key programmes in health, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), and climate resilience could suffer major setbacks.\n\nOne of the experts, however, added India's growing economy may be able to offset some of the immediate fallouts, but other nations such as Sudan, Ukraine and Uganda will suffer more.\n\nThe head of an NGO working in the development sector said the USAID exit will have a \"huge impact,\" as the agency has been at the forefront of tackling several issues.\n\n\"They have been on the frontier working on TB, maternal health and WASH. The have initiated so many innovative programmes. They created a programme under WASH called local development. The impact is going to be huge, even in terms of the nature of intervention,\" she said, requesting anonymity.\n\nShe emphasised that long-term change requires sustained collaboration and leadership, which the USAID provided.\n\n\"If you do one thing very well but don't strengthen related areas, you may see short-term gains, but they won't endure. Holistic change needs donors like USAID. They were even providing leadership. We had a sub-grant from them, never a direct grant, but they were running something called Momentum, which was really helping in reproductive health. We also work at the grassroots, and we saw the impact it was having on the ground,\" she added.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk recently announced President Donald Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.\n\nAccording to the founder of a health sector NGO, USAID grants had already been shrinking in recent years, with the agency focusing more on sustaining existing programmes rather than launching new ones.\n\n\"But even that plays an important role,\" he said. \"If these programmes fail or slow down, communities feel demoralised. We cannot afford a failure, and then it becomes very difficult to get a groundswell.\" Population Foundation of India Executive Director Poonam Muttreja criticised the decision to close USAID.\n\n\"Elon Musk's baseless claim that USAID is a 'criminal organization' is not just absurd', it is dangerous. For decades, USAID has been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts, providing life-saving aid to some of the world's most vulnerable populations. Dismissing it with such reckless rhetoric ignores the millions who rely on its programmes and undermines America's credibility as a global leader in development,\" Muttreja said.\n\nShe warned that while India's growing economy may be able to offset some of the immediate fallout, other nations dependent on USAID's support such as Sudan, Ukraine, and Uganda' will suffer.\n\n\"Some of the world's most vulnerable populations, from Sudan, Ukraine and Uganda to the Ivory Coast, will see maternal and mental health services disrupted or eliminated. Millions of women in Afghanistan, Gaza, Ukraine, and other crisis zones now face uncertainty,\" she said, adding that the move reinforces a broader U S retreat from international cooperation following its withdrawal from the World Health Organization.\n\nUSAID has been a crucial partner in addressing India's development challenges, leveraging local financial and human resources to drive large-scale projects.\n\nOver the years, the agency established 34 public-private partnerships, mobilising an additional USD380 million to advance critical initiatives.\n\nOne of USAID's most significant contributions has been in health care, particularly in reducing child and maternal mortality, combating tuberculosis and HIV, and improving sanitation.\n\nIts maternal and child health programmes across six states have helped 2.8 million pregnant women and 2.6 million newborns access better medical care.\n\nAdditionally, the USAID work in making 1,000 cities open-defecation-free and reducing diarrhea-related deaths among children under five has been pivotal, according to USAID website.\n\nThe agency said it has also played a key role in India's clean energy and climate resilience efforts. It has worked with state governments to deploy rooftop solar systems, promote energy-efficient technologies, and improve forest management.\n\nWith India home to nine of the world's 10 most polluted cities, USAID's role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting the green bond market has been critical.\n\nInternally, the situation within USAID remains uncertain, with employees grappling with the abrupt decision and its implications.\n\n\"There's complete chaos right now. No one knows what's happening, and there's been no clear directive from leadership on how to wind down operations,\" said a USAID official involved in South Asia programs, speaking anonymously.\n\n\"Programs that have taken years to build could collapse overnight, leaving millions without crucial support.\" Beyond India's domestic challenges, USAID has played a strategic role in fostering regional stability by promoting trade and investment, particularly with Afghanistan.",

I thought maybe it was because I look at the screen a lot; my eyes always feel a little irritated, grainy. I'm always cleaning them or trying to blink. I thought that was it. It turns out I'm an idiot and my doctor said, 'No, it's dry eye,'\" Andrews said in the interview.Erin Andrews has discovered a prescription eye drop to alleviate her dry eye condition, which she plans to share with the audience. \"For example, if you're constantly rubbing your eyes or squinting or thinking, 'Oh, my eyes are super dry or irritated,' ask someone about it because there actually is something that can relieve your symptoms,\" she said.Erin Andrews rose to fame as a sportscaster with the American cable sports channel ESPN, which she joined in 2004.

Outbreaks have occurred in countries in Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, the Caribbean, and Indian and Pacific Oceans.\n\nMost people infected with chikungunya virus develop some symptoms. Symptoms of chikungunya usually begin 3\u20137 days after a bite by an infected mosquito. The most common symptoms are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash. Most people get better within a week; however, some can have severe joint pain for months to years following acute illness.\n\nPeople at risk for more severe disease include newborns infected around the time of birth, older adults (65 years or older), and people with medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. Death from chikungunya is rare.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for chikungunya; however, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends a vaccine for some travelers.",

      "title": "Winston Churchill in an obesity ad? Ministry of Health\u2019s post sparks hilarious debate",
      "content": "Credit: X/@MoHFW_INDIA\n\nThe larger than life image of Churchill\n\n\n\nCredit: X/@OutlawsPoetic\n\nThe history between India and Churchill\n\n\n\nCredit: X/@yoemsri\n\nPublic health campaigns are meant to inform, but sometimes, they spark unexpected debates. On February 4, India\u2019s Ministry of Health posted an anti-obesity ad on X, featuring a silhouette of an overweight figure covered in warnings about related health risks. While the message seemed clear, some users noticed something unusual\u2014the outline looked strikingly similar to Winston Churchill . The resemblance has since fueled online discussions, with many questioning whether it was a mere coincidence or an intern throwing shade, given the history shared between India and Churchill.The original post by the MoH was captioned \u201cObesity can lead to severe health issues! But the good news? You can take control of your health at any time. Small lifestyle changes can make a big difference. Choose health today for a better tomorrow.\u201dHowever, one user reposted the original post and captioned it: \u201cIndia hates Churchill so much that its Ministry of Health uses his silhouette as a stand-in for an obese person\u201d. As the post gained traction, social media users were quick to react, flooding the comment section with a mix of humor, outrage, and speculation. One user said, \u201cFamines during the colonial era are one of the causes of obesity and diabetes among current Indian generations.\u201d Another user reposted the post and said, \u201cPeople\u2019s Padma for the intern who used Churchill\u2019s silhouette on an ad about obesity.\u201dWinston Churchill's iconic image is deeply etched in the annals of history, characterized by several distinctive features that have come to symbolize his persona and leadership.Winston Churchill's image was defined by his rotund physique, signature bow ties, and ever-present cigar. His stout build became a focal point in cartoons and caricatures, emphasizing his larger-than-life persona. He often wore tailored suits with a Homburg hat, exuding authority and sophistication. His love for cigars, which began in Cuba in 1895, became an iconic part of his identity\u2014so much so that he even had a special oxygen mask designed to let him smoke during flights.Winston Churchill is often celebrated as the resolute leader who guided Britain through the darkest days of World War II, rallying the nation from the brink of defeat to ultimate victory. However, his legacy in India is marred by policies and statements that have left a lasting impact.During the Bengal famine of 1943, which resulted in the deaths of millions, Churchill's policies have been scrutinized for exacerbating the crisis. He has been quoted as attributing the famine to the fact that Indians were \"breeding like rabbits,\" and questioning, \"If the shortages were so bad, why hasn't Gandhi died yet?\"Even after India gained independence, Churchill's disdain was evident. He reportedly remarked, \"If Independence is granted to India, power will go to the hands of rascals, rogues, freebooters; all Indian leaders will be of low caliber and men of straw.\"",

      "content": "England captain Jos Buttler has called on his side to play better for longer after falling to a four-wicket defeat against India in the first of a three-match ODI series in Nagpur.\n\nPhil Salt's 43 off 26 balls saw England race to 75 without loss after electing to bat first, only to lose three wickets in the space of eight balls and never manage to regain their momentum.\n\nButtler and Jacob Bethell half-centuries helped England to 248 all out in 47.4 overs, with India recovering from falling 19-2 to cruise to their victory target with 68 balls to spare.\n\nImage: Jacob Bethell, right, and Jos Buttler put on a 59-run stand for the fifth wicket\n\nThe latest defeat follows a 4-1 T20 series loss against the same opposition, with former England captain Kevin Pietersen labelling their bowling as \"predictable\" during India's run chase.\n\n\"Obviously disappointed not to win,\" Buttler said in the post-match presentation. \"We got off to a fantastic start, the two guys [Salt and Ben Duckett] were very aggressive in the power play.\n\n\"Losing four wickets so close together put us back. When you see the way the wicket played, another 40 or 50 runs could have been crucial.\n\nImage: Phil Salt scored 43 and Ben Duckett posted 32 for England\n\n\"This is not how we want to play. We want to put the opposition under pressure and keep the momentum going as long as possible. That has been the same through the T20s, as well as today.\n\n\"The game was in the balance, but credit to Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill, who put together a good partnership. We need to play better for longer, we need to execute our plans better, and when we get momentum and the opposition under pressure extend that for longer.\"\n\nEngland 'need to sharpen up'\n\nEngland's defeat came in their first ODI match since a series defeat against the West Indies in November, with Joe Root and Buttler both returning to 50-over international cricket since 2023.\n\nButtler's side now have two more matches to improve ahead of this month's Champions Trophy, live on Sky Sports, with Australia, South Africa and Afghanistan in their group for the eight-team tournament.\n\n\"The tools are all there,\" former England cricketer Matt Prior told TNT Sports. \"We know how talented the squad is and the team is, but you've got to go out and execute your plans on the field.\n\n\"For me, you could tell they haven't played 50-over cricket for a long time. There were just sloppy mistakes and it was just a bit lacklustre. For England, the talent is there, the ability is there, but they just need to sharpen up in a number of areas.\"\n\nFormer England bowler Steven Finn, also part of TNT Sports' coverage, added: \"If India see a chink in your armour, especially bringing all their big guns back in, they are going to take advantage of it.\n\n\"England did have them on the ropes in that first nine overs, but a sign of a good team is one that does exactly what India did. The couple of crucial moments in the game, where they needed to take their opportunity to pile through the door, they did.\"\n\nEngland in India - results and fixtures \ud83c\udfcf\n\nAll times UK and Ireland \u23f0\n\nWatch every match from the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy live on Sky Sports between February 19 and March 9.

      "content": "Not Rishabh Pant! Sanjay Bangar Reveals Which Star India Batter Impressed Ravi Shastri Even Before Debut (Photo credit: ICC)\n\nFormer India batting coach Sanjay Bangar has revealed that when Ravi Shastri saw the first glimpse of Shubman Gill in his first nets session with the national team, he was extremely impressed and exclaimed how the Indian team had bagged a 'ready' player. Gill, who debuted for India on the tour of New Zealand in 2019, came a long way through the six years of his career as he was elevated to the role of Rohit Sharma's deputy last year during the Sri Lanka tour and will also fulfil the role in the Champions Trophy.\n\nGill didn't have a memorable debut in New Zealand, scoring just nine and seven runs in the two ODIs he played. However, Bangar, speaking to Star Sports, recounted his first-ever India nets session.\n\nBangar revealed that every cricketer aiming for a spot in the national team must undergo a traditional screen test, in which batters, particularly, must face throwdowns.\n\n\"The first glimpse of Shubman Gill we had during his first net session for India, there is a tradition in India that during the nets session, if you want that approval, you will have to do well against throwdown specialists, who bowl fast,\" Bangar said.\n\n\"He was so impressive in that net session which was his screen test that Ravi Shastri was left stunned and said 'Ek taiyaar player mil gaya humein (We\u2019ve got someone ready for international cricket)'. Such was his first impact,\" Bangar added.\n\nOn February 6, Gill orchestrated India's chase gracefully, while debutant Harshit Rana dazzled with the ball as the hosts registered a four-wicket victory over England in the first of three ODIs.\n\nGill (87), Shreyas Iyer (59) and Axar Patel (52) rose to the occasion, guiding India to a commanding chase after Rana (3/53 from 7 overs) and the seasoned left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja (3/26 from 9) shared six wickets between them, dismantling England for a below-par 248.",

      "content": "The Indian team handed mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy his maiden ODI cap in the 2nd game of the three-match series. Varun received his cap on Sunday, 9 February, from Ravindra Jadeja, after having a sensational T20I series against England, where he picked up 14 wickets from 5 matches.\n\nVarun, 33 years and 164 days old, became India's second-oldest debutant in ODIs behind legendary wicketkeeper Farokh Engineer, who had made his debut in 1974 at the age of 36 years and 138 days. Varun has steadily risen in the 50-over format and was the best spinner in the recently concluded Vijay Hazare Trophy, India's premier 50-over competition.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIND vs ENG, 2nd ODI: Updates\n\nVarun's inclusion in the ODI XI is a crucial move for the Indian team as he might be fast-tracked for the Champions Trophy 2025. India are keeping Varun as one of the emergency options in case Jasprit Bumrah is not able to recover in time for the ICC tournament.\n\nVarun was the standout bowler in the recently concluded T20I series, troubling the England batters in every single game. England were not able to figure out Varun in any of the series and lost wickets in clumps against him. On Sunday, the spinner replaced Kuldeep Yadav in the line-up, who picked up just one wicket in the first game.\n\nVarun was not the only change India made on Sunday. The team decided to bench opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, who debuted in the last game. Virat Kohli returned to the playing XI after sitting out the first game due to a knee injury. The batter replaced Jaiswal, and is expected to bat at No.3 in the line-up with Shreyas Iyer at No.4.\n\nEngland, on the other hand, made wholesale changes to their lower order. Jofra Archer, Jacob Bethell, and Brydon Carse were rested for the game. Mark Wood, Gus Atkinson, and Jamie Overton walked into the playing XI.\n\nPublished By: Kingshuk Kusari Published On: Feb 9, 2025",

Primarily because RCB are one of the most popular franchises when it comes to IPL or WPL in world cricket. On Monday, February 3, Royal Challengers Bengaluru officially launched the Sports Forward Nation Report. This report was inspired by two events. The first one being India bidding for the 2036 Summer Olympics. Second, it was a collection of ideas that were generated during the RCB Indian Sports Summit in November 2023.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSports Forward Nation documents the importance of ensuring that sports and physical activity are well integrated and accessible from grassroots to elite level. Currently, there is a significant growth in the sports technology business landscape, performance initiatives amongst stakeholders and work done within communities and sports for society.\n\nWPL 2025: Full coverage\n\nRajesh Menon, the COO of RCB spoke about the benefits of Sports Forward Nation in an exclusive interview with Sports Today. Menon remarked,\n\n\u201cSports Forward Nation was started by how we could contribute back to Indian sport. With PM Modi\u2019s vision of hosting the 2036 Olympics in India, we thought about how we can help in the participation of athletes. We invest in the upcoming talent. When they start performing, that will be the fodder for us to take them forward.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlso Read: WPL can impact women's cricket the same way as IPL for men, says Smriti Mandhana\n\nWhat are the key elements of Sports Forward Nation?\n\nSports Forward Nation might have been inspired by India\u2019s push to host the 2036 Olympics, but it underlines the importance of sport as a nation-building component for 2047, the year when India celebrates its 100th Independence Day. The Sports Forward Nation has identified four pillars for growth of the sports ecosystem. These include commerce, technology, performance and societal impact. A cohesive ten-step roadmap has been implemented to build an ecosystem that drives sport forward and positions it as a key driver of national progress.\n\nThe ten steps that Sports Forward Nation has suggested are developing policy blueprints and frameworks, building regulatory institutions, creating transparent talent progression paths, provide sustainable business climate, use technology, sports entrepreneurship, integrating physical literacy in schools, enhance nation-wide sports participation, leverage sports as tool for social and development purpose and invest in sports science as well as indigenous knowledge.\n\nWith India trying to become a sports superpower, Sports Forward Nation is a report that could fuel India\u2019s ambition for sporting growth in the coming years and decade.",

The barren run of skipper Rohit Sharma and the selection conundrum that Virat Kohli's possible return poses are the towering obstacles in India's quest for a series win against England. Kohli, who missed the first game due to a swollen knee, is all set to return in the second ODI and highly likely to replace an in-form Shreyas Iyer.\n\nIf the past norms are followed, then Kohli will walk in for Shreyas, but it is more likely that Yashasvi Jaiswal could be the one who will have to make for the batting icon.

      "content": "MUMBAI: Racing enthusiasts are still trying to figure out the reasons behind the result of last Sunday's Indian Derby . While few dispute that Ranquelino was a deserving winner, the underwhelming performances of several leading contenders continue to baffle many.TOI spoke to former top jockey-turned-trainer PS Chauhan and trainer Adhirajsingh Jodha to dissect why the race unfolded the way it did.\"I believe most of the fancied runners were compromised by their wide draws, which significantly impacted their chances,\" observed Chauhan. \"At Mahalaxmi, the first turn comes up quickly, and those drawn wide had to cover at least an extra 100 meters to get in position.\"Chauhan also pointed to the blistering early pace set by African Gold as a key disruptor. \"Billy Lee (the jockey) burned up his mount's chances by going to the front too aggressively,\" he noted. \"If an Indian rider had done that, he'd probably be looking at a lengthy suspension,\" he added with a chuckle.Jodha, meanwhile, credited the trio of runners who exceeded expectations. \" Santissimo simply couldn't find more, despite Oisin Murphy's best efforts, while Psychic Star may have felt the toll of contesting three Indian Classics earlier in the season,\" he opined.While post-mortems of the Indian Derby will continue, the simple truth remains-big races don't come with guarantees. Wide draws and race-day dynamics will always play their part, but champions are forged in adversity. Ranquelino seized his moment, while others faltered, leaving punters and pundits alike to ponder the eternal question: was it misfortune or just another day at the races?",

      "title": "How India Can Boost Sports Tourism - India Report",
      "content": "Indian travelers want to experience live events. But India has a long way to go before it can fully monetize the potential of sports tourism.\n\nSelect a question above or ask something else\n\nIndia's sports tourism sector is anticipated to grow significantly, reaching $53 billion by 2033. Despite its potential, the sector faces challenges such as outdated infrastructure and seasonal dependence on events. A KPMG report suggests strategies like diversifying sports offerings, leveraging technology, and promoting local culture to enhance the tourism experience. A considerable number of Indian sports travelers are spending significantly on trips, indicating strong economic potential for the industry.\n\nThe Skift India Newsletter is your go-to platform for all news related to travel, tourism, airlines, and hospitality in India. The Skift India Newsletter is your go-to platform for all news related to travel, tourism, airlines, and hospitality in India. Learn More\n\nIndia\u2019s sports tourism market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 17% and reach $53 billion by 2033. A new report by KPMG \u2013 \u2018Harnessing India\u2019s Sports Tourism Potential\u2019 \u2013 looks at the challenges India faces in capturing this potential.\n\n\u201cThe sports tourism sector, while lucrative and rapidly expanding, also poses several weaknesses and threats that need to be addressed persistently to harness its full potential,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt listed challenges such as outdated and poor-quality infrastructure, road congestion and pollution, and over-dependence of some destinations on sports tourism. It also raised the seasonality of sporting events as an issue, and the need for heightened security at high-profile events.\n\nTo offset these, the report suggested certain measures:\n\nDiversifying offerings by including lesser-known amateur and adventure sports to attract local or repeat visitors. That can help deal with seasonality by providing alternatives for down times.\n\nUsing technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality to improve audience experience. Additionally, technology can also be used to manage crowds and improve security.\n\nPromoting local culture and local tourism activities along with sport events can improve visitor experience and lead to longer stays. \"For example, coupons may be offered to participants and tourist to spend at local stores, restaurants, and other services. Sport-event planning is an opportunity to advertise the destination,\" the report said.\n\nPromoting events that practice sustainability can attract audience passionate about that cause.\n\nEarlier this year, a report by travel services company Collinson showed that about 80% sports fans in India are traveling for experience. More than 50% of Indian sports travelers are also spending over $500 per trip per person. For a country where middle class individuals have an annual income between $6,000 and $36,000, this is a significant amount.\n\nIn June, Skift had reported that online travel companies were witnessing up to 40% surge in demand for big-ticket global sporting events, including cricket World Cup series, Wimbledon, the Olympics, and F1.\n\nIndiGo\u2019s Venture Capital Fund Gets Green Light\n\nIndian airline IndiGo\u2019s corporate venture capital fund IndiGo Ventures has received the approval from capital market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Through this fund, IndiGo aims to invest in startups that \u201chave the potential to redefine the future of aviation and beyond,\u201d the airline said in a statement.\n\nMore specifically, it will look at ventures that will work on technologies and solutions within the aviation sector, and consumer startups having a touchpoint in the passenger journey across travel, lifestyle, hospitality, and transportation aspects.\n\nIndiGo Ventures has set up the portal and is engaging with a few startups and their founders. The airline expects to start investments by the end of the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nSarovar Hotels Opens Golden Tulip in North Goa\n\nSarovar Hotels has opened Golden Tulip Vagator in North Goa. The 30-key retreat is a part of the hotel chain\u2019s strategy to expand its footprint in Goa.\n\nAjay Bakaya, Managing Director, Sarovar Hotels, said that Goa is a vital market for the company as the region is witnessing consistent growth in tourism.\n\nThe company has more than 125 operational hotels in India and overseas. It aims to have 150 operational hotels in India by the end of 2025. \u201cThese are conservative numbers. I want to ensure that we open hotels smoothly and properly rather than in a rush,\u201d Bakaya said to Skift in an earlier interview. The company is looking at a pipeline of 70 to 80 hotels currently.\n\nBengaluru Airport Partners with E-Flying Taxi Startup\n\nBengaluru Airport has tied up with Sarla Aviation to explore electronic air mobility solutions. In a post on Twitter, the Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) wrote, \u201cTogether, we are pioneering the development of new operational models for seven-seater eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft.\u201d\n\nKempegowda International Airport Bengaluru (BLR Airport) and Sarla Aviation have signed a statement of collaboration to explore innovative and sustainable air mobility solutions. This partnership marks a new chapter in our commitment to Advanced Air Mobility solutions developed\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZGlPHxlV1Q \u2014 BLR Airport (@BLRAirport) October 11, 2024\n\nIn simpler words, the move is aimed at introducing e-flying taxis in the city. On its website, Sarla Aviation said that it is targeting Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, and Pune to make \u201caerial ride-sharing as affordable as current Uber or Ola rides.\u201d\n\nIt also claims that e-flying taxis could cover the route from Bengaluru Airport to Electronic City in 19 minutes as compared to 152 minutes via road, and at a lower cost: INR 1,700 ($21) as compared to cab aggregator Ola\u2019s INR 2,500 ($29).\n\nClarissa Group Opens First 5-Star Resort\n\nThe Clarissa Group has announced the opening of Clarissa Resort & Spa Mukteshwar in Nainital. This marks the hotel chain\u2019s first 5-star property, and the third property in its portfolio.\n\nIn a statement, the group said that the move is a part of its expansion spree. It currently operates two 4-star properties in Jim Corbett and Goa. The hotel chain\u2019s focus is on creating luxury properties in natural landscapes.",

      "content": "Junior athletes winning international medals will no longer receive cash awards from the government. This major Sports Ministry policy shift, which came into effect on February 1, is aimed at tackling the twin menace of doping and age fraud as well as \u201ckeeping the hunger of youngsters alive\u201d.\n\nAccording to the old system, a gold medal at the Junior World Championship would fetch an athlete approximately Rs 13 lakh while a top of the podium finish at Asian or Commonwealth had a cash prize of Rs 5 lakh.\n\nA Sports Ministry official said one of the key factors behind this decision was to promote junior competitions as developmental events rather than making it all about a podium finish.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWe noticed that only India follows a model where junior championships are given over-importance. As a result, we have noticed that athletes work so hard at this level that by the time they reach the elite stage, they are either burnt out or have lost the hunger,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe award policy for senior athletes, too, has seen a rewrite. The Ministry has removed Commonwealth Championship and South Asian Games from the events on the award list. Chess players winning International Master or Grandmaster norms, too, will no longer be incentivised.\n\nIn an apparent change of stance, following shooter Manu Bhaker\u2019s unprecedented two bronze medals at last year\u2019s Paris Games, sportspersons and their coaches will now be rewarded for \u201ceach medal won\u201d at the Olympics and World Championships. Akhara or academy where a medalist trained will be eligible for awards as well. The clause that barred an athlete\u2019s \u201cspouse, father, mother, brother and sister\u201d from receiving the award has been removed from the revised policy.\n\nOver the years, cash incentives were seen as one of the reasons that pushed the athletes and their coaches into committing age fraud and doping offences. According to National Anti-Doping Agency data as of January 13, more than 10% of the dope offenders in India since 2022 are minors \u2014 22 out of 204.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAnd while there is no central system monitoring the number of athletes who fudge their age, hundreds have been suspended over the few years across sports \u2014 with many more escaping the net.\n\n\u201cIt can be said that the cash awards are one of the reasons athletes are lured into adopting unfair means. Most of them come from humble backgrounds, so it is a case of high risk, high reward for them,\u201d said another official.\n\nThe decision to drop events like the Commonwealth Championship and South Asian Games, too, was taken to ensure athletes remain focused on competing in tougher and more important international events, like the continental and world cups/championships.\n\nMeanwhile, athletes winning events like the All-England Badminton Championship or the Candidates Tournament in chess will be given the same amount of cash prize as World Championship winners, given the high standard of competition there.",

      "content": "Relevance: The budget week has just passed, and while the entire country focused on wealth and taxes, isn\u2019t it equally important to discuss financial ethics and its many dimensions? UPSC Ethics Simplified draws your attention to topics related to applied ethics. UPSC recently has been focussing on contemporary issues and raising some ethical questions for the candidates. In the past, we have viewed Pollution, War and Sports from the prism of ethics. Today, Nanditesh Nilay, who writes fortnightly for UPSC Essentials, takes us through an important theme of \u2018Money and Ethics\u2019.\n\nLet\u2019s revisit the year 2024 and the incident related to the White House, where a Senate campaign accepted around thirty-two thousand dollars from over ten healthcare and chemical industries. There was nothing new in it\u2014data shows that the White House has been receiving huge sums of money from dozens of companies since at least 2019. However, the world was stunned when Health and Human Services Secretary nominee RFK Jr. directly confronted Bernie Sanders, saying, \u201cBernie, you have accepted millions of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry. In 2020, you were the single largest receiver of pharmaceutical dollars\u2014$1.5 million.\u201d\n\nEven in a democracy like America, financial temptation remains a powerful force. The 2008 economic crisis is a testament to this reality. Closer home, in our own country, even the brightest minds often compromise for money. How can we forget the case of CGST bureaucrats caught in bribery or the constable involved in a multi-crore scam?\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nVishal Gupta, in his paper Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Crony Capitalism: A Review, argues: \u201cOne of the ways corruption occurs in public service delivery is through bribes paid to access or expedite services. Another, less overt but equally damaging, form of corruption is when public resource allocation is distorted by money, power, access, or connections\u2014also known as crony capitalism. The Indian Administrative Service (IAS) is considered a significant contributor to crony capitalism in India.\u201d\n\nSo, where should we begin with finance and ethics?\n\nFinancial ethics must grapple with two powerful variables\u2014ethics itself and the dynamic nature of money, which can easily lead to greed, arrogance, and ego.\n\nLet\u2019s revisit some important values from religion and scriptures. Dharma, the essence of righteousness, is the very heart of Hinduism. It awakens us from our slumber and guides us toward our duties without attachment to the fruits of our actions. One of its integral aspects, Asteya, extends beyond the simple idea of non-stealing\u2014it urges us to guard ourselves against all forms of temptation. It is not just about refraining from financial dishonesty but also about resisting envy, as even coveting what belongs to others is a form of theft.\n\nSimilarly, the principle of Aparigraha, rooted in Jain philosophy, teaches us non-attachment to material possessions. But do we truly embody these values? Do bureaucrats and citizens uphold Dharma, Asteya, and Aparigraha in their daily lives?\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAdmittedly, practicing these ideals is not easy. However, ethics form the foundation of wisdom. An ethical mind remains conscious, capable of discerning right from wrong in any situation. And when it comes to second variable, money, we must remember that it is not excellence itself\u2014it is merely the byproduct of excellence.\n\nHow can one remain conscious and resist greed in a consumer-driven world?\n\nAristotle offers an answer through his Golden Mean theory, which advocates for a balanced approach to wealth accumulation and spending. He emphasizes that money should not be seen as an end in itself but as a means to lead a virtuous life rather than a luxurious one.\n\nThe Tatas exemplify this principle, proving that industries and individuals can accumulate wealth while maintaining ethical integrity, free from greed. They chose to become trustees of their wealth, recognizing their responsibility toward their countrymen and the environment.\n\nMoreover, when money\u2014traditionally a variable of power\u2014becomes a tool to uplift the powerless, governance and decision-making undergo a profound transformation. Philosopher John Rawls, through his Difference Principle, justifies wealth inequality only if it ultimately benefits the least advantaged, ensuring that the welfare of all is prioritized.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIf society indulges in deception and the relentless pursuit of personal gain, how can the principle of the Categorical Imperative be upheld? Immanuel Kant\u2019s maxim, \u201cDo not do unto others what you would not want done to yourself,\u201d collapses when greed-driven and deceitful transactions thrive amid a widespread trust deficit. A lack of financial ethics fuels unchecked temptations and fosters insolent civic behavior. The world is witnessing an alarming nexus between politics and capitalism, which severely tarnishes the image of civil service and the executive, rendering them increasingly dubious.\n\nGood Governance and financial ethics\n\nThe tragic stampede at Kumbh Mela should not be reduced to a political debate; instead, it demands care and compassion for the police officers, bureaucrats, staff, and countless others who toiled tirelessly, maintaining composure while managing the overwhelming crowd of millions. Equally, our empathy must extend to those who lost their loved ones in this sacred gathering.\n\nBeyond the immediate tragedy, this incident also brings to light the question of financial ethics. The Kumbh is primarily an event for the common people\u2014those who neither seek luxury nor aspire for the exclusive status of a Very Important Person (VIP). In such a setting, human values should have taken precedence, ensuring that those who came seeking a holy dip were safeguarded.\n\nComing to a broader point, good governance and responsible institutions should not enable unchecked capitalism but rather advocate for compassionate capitalism\u2014one that prioritizes humanity\u2019s well-being over the relentless pursuit of profit. Nations must recognize that their long-term investments should be in vaccines, healthcare, and the welfare of the planet, rather than in nuclear weapons and instruments of destruction. If this realization does not dawn upon us, financial ethics will continue to be overshadowed by greed and the insatiable pursuit of wealth.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAs Adam Smith aptly observed in An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,\n\nIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest.\n\nWhile self-interest drives economies, it is imperative that it is guided by ethics, empathy, and a broader vision for the collective good.\n\nLet\u2019s ponder\n\nAre elections driven by unethical funding, bribery, and deceit? Is wealth amassed through wrongful means, and is money treated as the ultimate power rather than a tool for progress? Has aggressive consumerism and the blind pursuit of riches distanced money from its true ethical purpose? If so, are we witnessing the erosion of financial integrity and the spirit of ethics itself?\n\nAmerica may pride itself on its military and financial dominance, but its true greatness lies in the ethical fabric of its social life. India, despite its historic struggles against corruption and exploitation, must not waver from its commitment to values and ethics. The journey of Bharat\u2019s development demands an unwavering dedication to financial integrity.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nUltimately, money devoid of moral reasoning is nothing but an empty figure. In the grand scheme of time, its true worth will be zero unless it finds its Dharma\u2014its ethical foundation\u2014turning that zero into something meaningful, like a \u20181\u2019 leading the way toward a just and prosperous society.\n\nPost Read Questions:\n\n1. \u201cMoney devoid of moral reasoning is nothing but an empty figure.\u201d Reflect on this statement in the context of financial ethics and its impact on the marginalized sections of society.\n\n2. The article raises concerns about aggressive consumerism and the erosion of financial integrity. Do you think modern capitalism is inherently unethical, or can it be aligned with social welfare?\n\n3. The article questions the role of money in elections, citing examples from the U.S. and India.

      "title": "Budget: Tax relief for Indian middle class",
      "content": "Tax relief for Indian middle class - but will it boost economy?\n\n1 February 2025 Archana Shukla BBC News Reporting from Mumbai\n\nGetty Images The federal government has announced measures to counter slowing growth\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition government has unveiled its first full-year budget after his party lost an outright majority in parliament last year. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced measures to counter slowing growth, rising prices and flagging consumption among the middle class in Asia's third-largest economy. After a period of world-beating growth of more than 8%, India is set for its slowest economic expansion in four years as stagnant wages and high food prices hit consumer spending and corporate profits. Here are five key takeaways from India's union budget:\n\nTax cuts for the middle class\n\nIn a major relief to millions of taxpayers, the government has raised income tax exemption limits, making earnings of up to 1.2m rupees ($13,841; \u00a311,165) - excluding special rate income like capital gains - entirely tax free. The finance minister has also announced tweaks to other income tax slabs which is likely to leave more money in the hands of the middle class. The income tax concessions to the middle class \"seems aimed at addressing the slump in urban consumption\", said Nomura's India Economist Aurodeep Nandi. The impact, however, could be limited since a tiny fraction of Indians pay direct taxes. In 2023, 1.6% of Indians (22.4 million people) actually paid income taxes, according to data presented in parliament. The market cheered the announcements with stocks of automobiles, consumer goods and online grocery companies rallying.\n\nGetty Images The government will continue spending on state-led infrastructure projects\n\nState-led infrastructure spending remains on track\n\nState-funded capital expenditure on major road, port and railway projects has been a key driver of India's growth engine since 2020. Despite an unexpected contraction in actual spending in the first nine months of this year, the government has modestly increased its infrastructure expenditure target for this year from 11.1 trillion to 11.2 trillion rupees ($129.18bn; \u00a3104.21bn). The government has also proposed offering interest-free loans to states to enable them to spend more on infrastructure development.\n\nBoost for nuclear energy, insurance\n\nThe budget has set a goal to generate 100GW of nuclear energy by 2047. As part of this plan, a Nuclear Energy Mission has been launched with a budget of 200bn rupees ($2.3bn, \u00a31.86bn). The plan is to deploy five indigenous reactors by 2033 and amend laws, like the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, to realise goals and get more private sector participation in the sector. Meanwhile, foreign direct investment limits for the insurance sector have been increased from 74% to 100%. \"This will aid foreign insurers' interest in investing in the growing Indian insurance market, where we expect strong premium growth to boost profitability,\" said Mohammed Ali Londe, Senior analyst at Moody's Ratings.\n\nSmall-scale industries and regulatory reform in focus\n\nIn order to ease the climate for doing business, which has been a major concern among investors, a high-level committee has been announced to undertake regulatory reforms in the non-financial sectors and reduce the compliance burden on corporations. The panel will make recommendations within a year. Small and micro industries, that account for 35% of India's manufacturing and create millions of jobs, also got a boost through fiscal support of 1.5 trillion rupees ($17.31bn; \u00a313.96bn) over the next five years. The government has also raised production-linked subsidies and slashed import duties for local manufacturing units across sectors like textiles, mobile telephones and electronics. This could promote private investments, which have not picked up post the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nGetty Images Small and micro industries get a boost through fiscal support\n\nBalancing the fiscal math",

      "content": "The Ministry of Finance has advised government officials to \u201cstrictly avoid\u201d Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, including ChatGPT and DeepSeek, on official devices as they \u201cpose risks for confidentiality of government data and documents\u201d.\n\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, which runs ChatGPT, is currently in India to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nDeepSeek, developed by China, was launched in January 2025.\n\nThe circular, accessed by The Hindu, was issued by the Department of Expenditure (DoE) on January 29, 2025.\n\n\u201cIt has been determined that AI tools and AI Apps (such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek etc.) in the office computers and devices pose risks for confidentiality of Govt. data and documents. It is, therefore, advised that use of AI tools/AI Apps in office devices may be strictly avoided. This may be brought to the notice of all employees. This issues with the approval of Finance Secretary,\u201d an order by Pradeep Kumar Singh, Joint Secretary, DoE said.\n\nOn January 30, Ashwini Vaishnaw, Union Minister for Information Technology, told The Hindu in an interview that DeepSeek would soon be hosted on Indian servers.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek is an open source model and we are very soon going to host DeepSeek on Indian servers, the way we have hosted Llama, so that the data privacy parameters can be addressed. That we will do soon. Already team has done that work. And we will soon be hosting open source models on Indian servers.

      "content": "In 2021, at the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, parties launched the UNFCCC\u2019s Ad-Hoc Work Programme on the NCQG to facilitate technical discussions between 2022 and 2024. The landscape of issues reveals a deep divide between the developed and developing country Parties to the UNFCCC. Several elements of the new goal need to be resolved: quantity, structure, quality, contributors, time frame and revisions, tracking and reviewing progress, and the relationship to the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term goal on climate finance.\n\nHeading into Baku, the stated quantum of the new goal will be key to ascertaining India\u2019s position on the negotiated outcome. Developing countries, including groupings such as the Group of 77 (G77) plus China and Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), have consistently called for discussion on the quantum of the NCQG based on their priorities and evolving needs. Developed countries, including the United States (US) and the European Union (EU), have not specified a target goal except that it will be from a floor of USD 100 billion per year. Instead, they have focused on the issue of who the contributors and recipients should be. They call for the contributor base to be expanded to include developing countries based on responsibility, economic capability and ability to contribute. On the question of who should receive the money, they make the case for the recipient base to include the most vulnerable and those with the greatest need.\n\nIndia\u2019s most recent submission to the ad-hoc working group states that the quantum of the NCQG must be public finance of at least USD 1 trillion per year, primarily in the form of grants and concessional finance. India also strongly opposes both expanding the contributor base and creating differentiation between beneficiaries \u2013 it has long maintained that developed countries must provide financing to support developing countries\u2019 climate actions, as envisaged under Article 4.3 of the UNFCCC and Article 9.1 of the Paris Agreement. A recent analysis highlights an erosion of trust in the multilateral process given past non-delivery of climate finance commitments and calls the NCQG an opportune window for the developed world to demonstrate leadership on paying its fair share to help developing countries address climate change. Therefore, India is likely to stand firm on raising the quantum of the new goal in a bid to hold developed countries more accountable for their climate finance obligations.",

      "title": "Sustainable Finance Flows to India\u2019s Agriculture Sector",
      "content": "India\u2019s agriculture sector faces a multifaceted \u201cGrand Challenge:\u201d Ensuring food security for a growing population, supporting rural livelihoods, and managing the adverse impacts of climate change, all while contending with limited resources, financial constraints, and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing these challenges necessitates a transition toward sustainable agriculture.\n\nThis report introduces a comprehensive sustainable agriculture framework developed using a value-chain approach to analyze relevant sectors, activities, policies, and key initiatives. It provides a detailed examination of financial flows in the agriculture sector during FY1 2020\u201321 and FY 2021-22, offering insights into public and private finance sources, intermediaries, and end-use activities across the entire agriculture value chain.\n\nBy mapping financial flows and highlighting investment opportunities, this report serves as a roadmap for stakeholders\u2014including policymakers, regulators, and private investors\u2014to transform challenges into opportunities. It aims to inspire collaborative efforts, from publicprivate partnerships to intergovernmental and intragovernmental initiatives, to mobilize finance and advance sustainable practices in India\u2019s agricultural landscape.\n\nKEY FINDINGS\n\n1. Overall financial flows slightly declined amid growing agricultural needs.\n\nAnnual financial flows to sustainable agriculture averaged INR 22,393 billion (USD 301 billion) for FY 2020-22. This was characterized by a 1.1% decline from INR 22,474 billion (USD 303 billion) in FY 202021 to INR 22,312 billion (USD 299 billion) in FY 2021-22.\n\nHowever, India\u2019s food demand is likely to increase to around 400 million tonnes by 2050 (Indian Agricultural Research Institute 2013), while production levels in FY 2022-23 were around 330 million tonnes (PIB 2023), translating to a five-year average growth requirement of approximately 4%.\n\n2. Private financing via commercial financial institutions (FIs) took the lead.\n\nCommercial FIs led the bulk of disbursements (99.5%) through loans primarily due to the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI\u2019s) priority-sector lending guidelines that mandate banks and other FIs to have 18% of their adjusted net bank credit or credit equivalent of off-balance sheet exposures in credit for agriculture and allied activities. During this two-year period, the total agriculture credit disbursed by FIs in India amounted to INR 34,387 billion (USD 462 billion), averaging INR 17,194 billion (USD 231 billion) each year (Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare 2023).\n\n3. Domestic sources far outweighed international.\n\nDomestic sources represented 99.5% of flows (INR 22,289 billion), with international sources contributing only 0.5% (INR 105 billion). This stark disparity reflects global trends, where Official Development Assistance (ODA) for agriculture is limited and fragmented, representing just 5.2% of total ODA globally as of 2018 (Bharali et al. 2021). This highlights the challenge of mobilizing international support to complement domestic resources and to further unlock value through capacity building, technical assistance, and other mechanisms for the development of sustainable agriculture in India.\n\n4. Government budgets are supporting sustainability in the agriculture sector.\n\nUnion and state governments in India allocated an annual average of INR 7,294 billion (USD 98 billion) to agriculture during FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22 (RBI 2023), of which INR 6,373 billion (USD 86 billion) went to the sustainable agriculture activities tracked by this study, mainly upstream and downstream activities.\n\nRead the full report to find out more.\n\nDownload the report",

      "content": "Reserve Bank of India announces first rate cut in nearly five years as world\u2019s most populous nation faces slowdown.\n\nIndia\u2019s central bank has cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nearly five years as officials try to reverse slowing economic growth in the world\u2019s most populous country.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on Friday that it had lowered the repo rate, which the central bank lends to commercial banks, by 0.25 percent to 6.25 percent.\n\nThe RBI last cut the key interest rate in May 2020, after which it rolled out a series of hikes aimed at tamping down rising inflation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra, who took over from his more hawkish predecessor Shaktikanta Das in December, said a less restrictive monetary policy was more appropriate in light of the current \u201cgrowth-inflation dynamics\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to conduct monetary policy and take such measures, as appropriate, which are timely, carefully calibrated and clearly communicated, to facilitate conducive macroeconomic conditions that reinforce price stability, sustained economic growth and financial stability,\u201d Malhotra said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia is growing faster than any other major economy, but the pace of its expansion has slowed considerably in recent months as rising food prices drag on consumption.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.4 percent year on year in the July-September quarter, after expanding 6.7 percent in the April-June period and 7.8 percent in the quarter before that.\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has forecast growth of 6.4 percent for the fiscal year 2024/25, which would be the weakest performance since 2020 when COVID-19 upended the global economy.\n\nGrowth is expected to come in at 6.3-6.8 percent in 2024/25, below its post-pandemic trend.\n\nModi\u2019s government last week announced sweeping tax cuts as part of the annual budget, raising the threshold at which workers are taxed on income from about $8,000 to $14,800.",

      "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi is counting on a two-pronged stimulus of tax and interest rate cuts to turn around India\u2019s slowing economy, but investors may need more convincing that the measures will be enough.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe decision by India\u2019s central bank on Friday to reduce its key rate for the first time in five years comes less than a week after Modi\u2019s government unveiled historic tax cuts in its federal budget. Taken together, the measures underscore the urgency with which Modi\u2019s government is moving to address the growth slowdown gripping the economy.\n\nYet, investor response to these steps has been muted throughout the week, illustrating the scale of the challenge facing the government. Bonds fell following the central bank announcement, while the benchmark NSE Nifty 50 index lost 0.2%.\n\nEconomists said that despite its 25 basis-point cut, the central bank\u2019s overall actions were relatively restrained. The bank\u2019s monetary policy committee voted to retain a \u201cneutral\u201d policy stance rather than change it to \u201caccommodative,\u201d which would have signaled more rate cuts to come.\n\nDespite the tax cuts, the budget was \u201ccontractionary\u201d and the central bank\u2019s ability to cut rates in the future is \u201climited\u201d at a time when the US Federal Reserve is pausing, said Indranil Sen Gupta, an economics professor at Shiv Nadar University.\n\nThe rupee\u2019s plunge to record lows means the Reserve Bank of India will need to tread cautiously in cutting interest rates too deeply to avoid undermining the currency, and thereby fuel more inflation.\n\nMoreover, the RBI announced no new liquidity measures that might have given markets a stronger boost, such as a cut to its cash reserve ratio or additional bond buyback measures.\n\nEconomists including Kaushik Das at Deutsche Bank AG sees just one more rate cut in this cycle, a 25 basis-point move in April.\n\n\u201cCutting the repo rate too much in this cycle may put pressure to reverse the easing in a quicker time period, which is not ideal for the economy,\u201d he wrote in a report.\n\nSome economists also question whether New Delhi is relying too heavily on dividend payouts by the central bank to finance its 1 trillion rupees ($11.4 billion) in tax cuts.

      "title": "India's finance minister faces a tough choice crafting the annual budget \u2014 boost growth or cut deficit?",
      "content": "In this article UBSG-CH Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nNirmala Sitharaman, India's finance minister, leaves the ministry to present the budget at the parliament in New Delhi, India, on July 23, 2024. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nAs the Indian government walks a tight rope between fiscal prudence and reviving growth, experts suggest it will likely favor cutting deficit in its annual budget over spending aimed at turbocharging Asia's third-largest economy. For the fiscal year ending March 2026, the Indian government could lower the fiscal deficit target by 50 basis points to 4.4% of the country's gross domestic product from the 4.9% target for the current fiscal year, economists at investment bank UBS said. They also projected the government would set a nominal GDP growth target of 10.5% for the next fiscal year. Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the national budget on Feb. 1, in what would be the coalition government's first full-year budget after assuming power in June. The budget comes against the backdrop of a growth slowdown in the world's fifth-largest economy, weak domestic demand, a depreciating rupee and rising global uncertainties. The slowdown in the economy has largely been attributed to factors such as unseasonal rainfall, fiscal tightening and tepid credit growth in the private sector as the central bank took steps to curb unsecured lending growth. The upcoming budget is likely to re-emphasize on jobs growth in the labor-intensive manufacturing sector, while promoting rural housing programs and additional steps to control prices volatility, Goldman Sachs said. As domestic consumption and economic activity slows, the budget might focus on \"fine-tuning existing measures and medium-term demand boost,\" said Radhika Rao, senior economist at DBS. \"Tax relief [also] tops this list ... even though a reduction in the personal income tax rates or standard exemption will impact a small part of the population, some support is likely in the pipeline,\" Rao added. To give consumption a boost, the central government is expected to lower personal income tax for middle-income households, she said, while continuing to prioritize spending on infrastructures, upgrading the country's roads, railways, airports and highways.\n\nDeficit focus\n\n\n\nSubscribe now Get a weekly roundup of news from India in your inbox every Thursday.\n\nOver the last seven years, the Indian government has consistently fallen short of fully utilizing the budgeted and additional expenditures approved through supplementary grants, using on average around 80% of the total available funds each year, according to Goldman Sachs. The shortfall has narrowed post-pandemic, when the government overshot its budgeted subsidies expenditure to cover rising food prices, it said. The investment bank projected the government's public expenditure to shrink further in the coming years, slowing to 3.2% of the GDP in fiscal year 2025-26. That fiscal discipline would \"remain a drag on growth in the next fiscal year,\" it said, suggesting that \"the fastest growth pace in public capex is behind us ... overall, there is not much room to boost welfare spending.\"\n\nEconomic slowdown\n\nThe world's fastest growing major economy has seen a growth downturn. India has been steadily cutting its full year real GDP forecasts after economic growth missed expectations in the quarter ending September, when its grew by 5.4% \u2014 its slowest expansion in nearly two years. The government has trimmed its economic growth outlook for the current fiscal year to the slowest level in four years, after three rounds of cuts brought estimates to 6.4% earlier this month from 7.2% in October. For the next fiscal year, Nomura analysts said the government might set a nominal GDP growth target of 10.3%, up from 9.7% for the current fiscal year ending March 2025. Still, hopes that Sitharaman will deliver a large fiscal package to pull the economy out of its recent soft patch in the upcoming budget are likely to be disappointed, Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics said in a note. While some additional \"accommodative tax and spending measures are on the cards,\" they are likely to be \"piecemeal,\" Shah added.\n\nMonetary easing\n\nDisinvestment goal",

The study considers both public and private sources of capital\u2014domestic as well as international\u2014to track the flow of finance from the source to the end beneficiaries through different instruments.\n\nIndia continues to expand its green finance flows.\n\nIndia\u2019s tracked green finance reached an all-time high in 2021/22, but more investment is required to meet the country\u2019s climate targets.\n\nHowever, given India\u2019s high vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, adaptation investment needs are likely to increase.\n\nSources and sectors of finance for mitigation\n\nFinance for mitigation was primarily domestically sourced (83%) in 2021/22. International finance increased to 17% (INR 620 billion/USD 8.3 billion) of India\u2019s total finance for mitigation from around 15% in 2019/20.\n\nSources and sectors of finance for adaptation\n\nTracked finance for adaptation continued to be dominated by domestic sources, though international finance for adaptation increased by 19% in 2021/22 on 2019/20. Finance for adaptation increased partly due to the tracking of an additional sector.\n\nConcluding observations\n\nIndia needs to urgently scale green finance to enable low-carbon and climate-resilient development. Based on this report\u2019s findings, CPI proposes the following priorities:\n\n1. Coordinated action to scale up green finance at a faster pace\n\nCreating market-based incentives, innovative financial products, and de-risking investments to accelerate green finance.\n\nAugmenting development banks\u2019 and FIs\u2019 important roles in mobilizing green finance through interventions that direct capital to green initiatives.\n\n2. Enhancing finance for adaptation\n\nFostering concerted effort and collaboration across various ministries and departments.\n\nEnsuring that state-level adaptation plans indicate estimated adaptation funding gaps, including sectoral gaps, to boost understanding of where finance needs to flow.\n\nBoosting private sector investment in adaptation by using public finance.\n\n3. Furthering policy and regulatory measures to mobilize green finance across all sectors, by:\n\nDeveloping and operationalizing a green/climate finance taxonomy.\n\nIntroducing national and subnational level legislation and regulations for adaptation.\n\n4. Making coordinated efforts across data collection, reporting, and access\n\nStandardizing and mandating disclosures.\n\nIncreasing availability and accessibility of climate finance data.\n\nPutting in place an integrated domestic measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system.\n\nDownload the full report",

      "content": "UK universities are aiming to leave their financial woes at home by seeking their fortunes in India, in a higher education version of a gold rush towards a market with more than 40 million students.\n\nThe University of Southampton has been first out of the blocks, announcing it is opening in Gurgaon, a satellite city of Delhi, and is now enrolling students for what it calls \u201cthe first campus of its kind in India\u201d.\n\nOthers are not far behind. Prof Chris Day, Newcastle University\u2019s vice-chancellor, last week told a British Council event in Delhi: \u201cIt almost seems that every day at the moment there\u2019s another announcement.\u201d\n\nDay said he was \u201cabsolutely convinced\u201d of the need for Newcastle University to open a campus in India, joining the vice-chancellors of Surrey, Coventry and many others said to be looking at plans.\n\nProf Aarti Srivastava, head of the higher education and professional education department at National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration in Delhi, said foreign universities were not allowed to operate their own campuses in India until 2023, when changes to regulations opened the doors.\n\n\u201cThe UK universities are aiming to ride the high tide of demographic bulge in India,\u201d Srivastava said. \u201cAlso the cost of living is low in India, therefore the cohort will be attracted to get a foreign degree at a low cost which will impact their employability in the long run.\u201d\n\nUK universities attracted more than 125,000 students from India in 2022-23, but shifting visa regimes and competition from international rivals make those numbers uncertain. By opening branch campuses in India universities can reach an untapped domestic market that is unable to study abroad.\n\nNick Hillman, director of the UK\u2019s Higher Education Policy Institute, said: \u201cThere is so much pent-up demand for this because India is seen as having more potential than anywhere else for the next wave of internationalisation within UK universities.\u201d\n\nIndian students wanting to take a BSc in business management at Southampton\u2019s home campus would pay \u00a324,000 in annual tuition fees, plus hefty visa, travel and accommodation costs.\n\nBut from August, the university\u2019s new branch at Gurgaon\u2019s International Tech Park, a special economic zone, will teach the same course for 1.3m rupees a year, about \u00a312,000.\n\nUndergraduate tuition at the University of Delhi, a leading public institution with 250,000 students, costs the equivalent of \u00a32,000. But demand for places is so high there are more than 58,000 colleges and universities, teaching 43 million students. Private universities are rapidly opening, charging fees of \u00a310,000 and more.\n\nThe Indian government wants half of young people to enrol in tertiary education, up from 28% in 2021-22, leaving plenty of room for UK universities to enter the market.\n\nMaddalaine Ansell, the British Council\u2019s director of education, said India was \u201cof great importance\u201d to UK higher education for students and academic partnerships.\n\n\u201cWe have worked with partners to help the UK sector to respond to recent reforms in Indian higher education, leading to a surge in collaborations. These range from joint and dual PhDs and master\u2019s degrees to the establishment of UK university campuses,\u201d Ansell said.\n\nProf Max Lu, the University of Surrey\u2019s vice-chancellor, was last week exploring a campus opening next year in Gujarat International Finance Tec (Gift) City in Ahmedabad, a special economic zone offering tax exemptions and profit repatriation for high-ranking foreign universities.\n\nGift City\u2019s first UK university resident is likely to be Queen\u2019s University Belfast (QUB), which has announced it will offer postgraduate courses there from January next year.\n\nQUB says the new campus will cost \u00a35m-\u00a37m \u2013 at a time when the university is seeking voluntary redundancies amid forecasts of a \u00a311m operating deficit.\n\nA QUB spokesperson said: \u201cThe investment in Gift City is unrelated to the university\u2019s voluntary severance scheme and it is vital to point out that there will be no compulsory redundancies as part of this process \u2026 Projected returns from the Gift investment will be reinvested into core university activities and are a key component in supporting the university\u2019s financial sustainability in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nJo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said it was \u201creprehensible\u201d for universities to undertake risky ventures abroad while cutting jobs at home.\n\n\u201cAll too often these vanity projects end up losing money or even shutting down,\u201d Grady said. \u201cThis reckless mismanagement could not be more at odds with the government\u2019s demand that universities take their civic responsibilities more seriously.\u201d",

      "content": "Delhi Elections Live Tax calculator\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nNew Delhi: Japanese investments in India are moving beyond the well-established patterns and are now exploring new avenues in financial services, electronics and telecommunications.According to Seiji Ota , partner at Deloitte India , Japanese investment patterns in India have evolved significantly over time.\"While the automotive and diversified industrial sectors have historically dominated Japanese capital allocation, recent years have witnessed a notable transformation in investment preferences. Financial services, electronics, telecommunications and media sectors have emerged as compelling destinations for Japanese investments,\" Ota told ET. Cutting-edge domains such as semiconductor manufacturing, sustainable technologies, infrastructure development and defence capabilities are among the new spheres being explored by Japanese investors.\"This diversification reflects a broader strategic shift in Japanese investment philosophy in India, moving beyond traditional manufacturing strongholds to embrace emerging technological and strategic sectors,\" Ota added. As per official data, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows from Japan into India were $43.11 billion between April 2000 and September 2024. Japan is India's fifth largest source of FDI, with a 6.08% share in total equity inflows.According to a Deloitte report, India came in first and Vietnam second in a fiscal 2023 ranking of promising countries and regions for investment for Japanese firms. While there has been a recent decrease in mergers and acquisition activities between India and Japan, this was due to the Covid pandemic.\"The market has been seeing a revival of those activities. We already see a roughly 30% increase from 2023 to 2024 (as of December 2024), which implies the investment momentum is robust from Japan to India,\" the report said, while adding that artificial intelligence, healthcare and renewables were key areas for dealmaking. Outbound deals from Japan to India stood at $1.22 billion (roughly 4.26% of total outbound deals $28.68 billion) during the first and second quarters of calendar year 2024. There were 343 inbound deals from Japan to India, resulting in investments of $62.35 billion during the past decade. Investments from India to Japan during this period totalled $4.85 billion. FDI flows to China have declined sharply, from a peak of $13.4 billion in 2012 to $3.4 billion in 2024. Conversely, FDI to India - $6 billion in 2024 - has been steadily increasing. The deal value peaked in 2021 with significant transactions such as Flipkart and Fullerton, suggesting tendencies to go for large deals, Deloitte said.A national policy of fostering STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) talent and escalating US-China tensions will further intensify the investments. \"India and Japan have been benefiting from the 'China Plus One' strategy, as investors look for alternatives in the region to park their money,\" the global consultancy major said in the report. Besides, there is also a huge potential for domestic demand to expand. India has a young population with an average age of 28 years and the largest working age population at 995 million in 2025. According to Deloitte, India is projected to post gross domestic product growth of 7.2% in 2024, followed by 6.6% in 2025 and 6.5% in 2026.This means inflation growth will remain within the range of economic growth despite inflation spikes due to food prices. The stable growth outlook for the Indian economy contrasts starkly from a negative outlook on the Chinese and Japanese economies.This is supplemented by a robust monetary policy and hefty foreign exchange reserves for India. In addition, India has a strong public investment climate with the rupee's fluctuation against the dollar, yen and other key currencies remaining comparatively lower. Rohit Berry, president-strategy, risk and transactions at Deloitte South Asia, says India is taking bold steps to bolster its role in the global supply chain. \"Successful partnerships between Indian and Japanese companies, coupled with sustained government support, will be pivotal in achieving this goal and enhancing the sector's resilience,\" he said. He highlighted India's recent economic reforms, including reduced compliances, decriminalised provisions and structural changes like liberalised foreign investment, modernised bankruptcy and labour laws, and a unified GST, to have greatly enhanced its business environment.\"Ongoing efforts to simplify regulations, dematerialise shares, streamline KYC processes, and rationalise GST slabs will further boost its appeal to foreign investors,\" Berry said.Further, the Indian government's support for manufacturing through production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for 14 sectors, extending an incentive of 4-6% on incremental sales, greatly improves prospects. Japanese companies such as Panasonic , TDK, Daikin, Toshiba, NEC and Fujitsu have benefited from the PLI schemes. There are around 755 beneficiaries of the PLI schemes and around \u20b91.5 lakh crore incremental investments of the targeted \u20b93 lakh crore have already come in. There is a production increase in terms of sales of \u20b912.5 lakh crore and employment generation for about 1.05 million people, both of which are a third of the original target.However, Deloitte said delays in incentive disbursement and approval processes, difficulties in meeting domestic value addition requirements within stipulated timeframes and steep year-on-year growth targets for revenue and production are some of the challenges with respect to the PLI schemes. Investors have also raised concerns on supply chain challenges such as an underdeveloped component ecosystem - particularly in electronics - and high dependency on imports for critical components and policy-related issues, including frequent changes in implementation guidelines.(This article is published in partnership with Deloitte)",

      "content": "India is likely to skip the February deadline for submitting the next round of climate action plans under the Paris Agreement requirements, The Indian Express has learnt. These plans, called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs, are supposed to provide details of the climate actions countries intend to take up to the year 2035.\n\nThe Paris Agreement requires its member countries to refresh their NDCs in five-year cycles. The existing NDCs, submitted in 2020, pertain to the 2030 period. At a meeting of Paris Agreement Implementation and Compliance Committee last year, it was decided to ask countries to submit their 2035 NDCs by February 10 this year, about nine months ahead of the year-ending annual climate conference. Advance submissions allow for adequate time to compile, seek clarifications, and produce synthesis reports.\n\nIndia, however, is not yet ready with its 2035 action plan, and in no hurry to meet the deadline. In fact, the Indian NDC might be submitted only in the second half of the year, closer to the annual climate meeting, being held in Brazil in November this year, official sources said. There are no penalties for late submissions. Not many countries have submitted their 2035 NDCs. Even many developed country parties are yet to make their submissions. The United States, incidentally, is among those that have submitted. The Joe Biden administration had approved and submitted the 2035 submissions in December, well before Donald Trump assumed charge.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIndia has also skipped the December 31, 2024 deadline for the submission of the first Biennial Transparency Report (BTR), the new format in which a country has to report its detailed inventory of emissions. This report is expected to be submitted around the middle of the year.\n\nThe sources also said that India\u2019s NDC would likely \u201creflect the disappointment of the climate finance outcome at COP29 in Baku\u201d last year. It is a subtle hint that its 2035 NDC was unlikely to be a significant or ambitious upgrade of climate actions compared to the existing NDC for 2030.\n\nIndia, and other developing countries, have expressed serious disappointment with the outcome of COP29, last year\u2019s climate conference in Baku, which delivered an extremely weak agreement on climate finance. The developing countries had been seeking a commitment of at least one trillion dollars every year from the developed world in climate finance. But developed countries agreed to mobilise no more than 300 billion dollars a year, and that too only from 2035.\n\nExplained Eye on hosting COP33 in 2028 Besides the climate finance issue, there is another reason why India is unlikely to stretch itself while making commitments for 2035 \u2014 it\u2019s planning to host the COP33 climate conference in 2028. Host countries usually announce new climate initiatives ahead of the conference to demonstrate their leadership and create momentum for a more meaningful outcome. India would like to leave some room for enhancing its NDC commitments during that time. It had enhanced its 2030 NDCs mid-way through the five-year cycle, having met two of its three initial targets well ahead of the 2030 deadline.\n\nDeveloped countries are obligated under the Paris Agreement to provide money to the developing nations to help them fight climate change, but the quantum of money has to be decided through the negotiated process. As of now, they are under a commitment to raise 100 billion dollars a year. COP29 in Baku was supposed to scale up this amount substantially, in keeping with multiple assessments of countries\u2019 needs, all of which had put the requirements in excess of a trillion dollars a year.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIndia had made an uncharacteristically strong criticism of the Baku agreement, calling the final agreed amount \u201cabysmally poor\u201d and \u201cpaltry\u201d. It has been saying that the lack of adequate finance was not just an abdication of responsibility by the developed countries, but also a major setback to global climate action. In the absence of international financial support, developing countries would be forced to lower the ambition of their climate actions, taking up only those that they can finance through their own resources, it said.\n\nThe Economic Survey presented last week also made a similar argument, and clearly hinted at a readjustment of climate targets by India.\n\n\u201cThe funding shortfall may lead to a reworking of the climate targets. Considering that domestic resources will be the key to action, resources for meeting development challenges may be affected, undermining progress toward sustainable development objectives and compromising the integrity of international climate partnerships,\u201d the Economic Survey said.\n\nFor the 2030 period, India has made three commitments. It has said it would reduce the emissions intensity of its economy (emissions per unit of GDP) by 45 per cent from 2005 levels, and would ensure that at least 50 per cent of its installed electricity generation capacity comes from non-fossil fuel sources. It has also promised to increase its forest and tree cover so that they can absorb an additional 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. India is on course to achieve all these three targets well ahead of 2030.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe 2035 NDC has to be a progression over the 2030 targets. But the scale of this progression is to be decided by the countries themselves, in keeping with their capabilities and resources.\n\nThere is another reason why India is unlikely to stretch itself right now while making commitments for 2035. It is planning to host the COP33 climate conference in 2028. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced this intention at COP28 in Dubai in 2023. Host countries usually announce some new climate initiatives ahead of the conference to demonstrate their leadership and create a momentum for a more meaningful outcome. India would like to leave some room for enhancing its NDC commitments during that time.\n\nIt had enhanced its 2030 NDCs also mid-way through the five-year cycle, having achieved two of its three initial targets well in advance of the 2030 deadline.",

      "content": "Finfluencer and Wisdom Hatch founder Akshat Shrivastava in a post decoded how wealthy individuals in India manage and grow their investments, focusing on a simple yet powerful strategy of balancing stocks and real estate.\n\n\n\n\"Almost every rich person I speak with these days buys stocks and real estate (both) now,\" he explained.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStocks, according to Shrivastava, provide growth and liquidity, while real estate offers stability and cash flow. This dual approach allows the wealthy to strategically rotate their capital for optimal returns. \"In bad times, they leverage their real estate and raise cash, which they then invest in stocks for a higher alpha. When stocks become overvalued, they sell it and buy real estate with it,\" he added.\n\nHighlighting Jeff Bezos as an example, Shrivastava emphasized, \"Go and study -- Jeff Bezos, who is not even shy in terms of selling Amazon stocks and rotating that capital into real estate.\" This approach, he claims, underscores the importance of capital rotation. \"It took me 10 years to realise this simple game,\" he noted.\n\nAlmost every rich person I speak with these days: buys stocks & real estate (both) now.\n\n\n\n(1) Stocks: provide growth and liquidity.\n\n(2) Real Estate: provides stability and cash flow.\n\n\n\nIn bad times, they leverage their Real Estate and raise cash. Which they then invest in\u2026 \u2014 Akshat Shrivastava (@Akshat_World) February 6, 2025\n\nHowever, not everyone agreed with this strategy. A user commented, \"Examples you took are people with heavy cash flow. Ticket size for stocks is very low, but not for residential real estate. Retail users cannot afford commercial real estate due to high ticket sizes. On paper, it's easy to talk about accumulating real estate, but everyone cannot compare themselves to Jeff or Gates.\"\n\nAnother user highlighted the broader concept of asset allocation: \"Yes, this is the core of asset allocation. Wealth needs to be divided between different asset classes. Buying when an asset is depressed in value will lead to above-normal returns. The key is that assets should not be correlated, like stocks and bonds, or even inversely related, like stocks and gold. As they say, asset allocation is the only free lunch in finance.\"",

      "title": "India fires warning shot with rejection of finance deal at COP29",
      "content": "India gave a fiery speech after UN talks approved a new climate finance goal, suggesting rich nations are failing in their duty to help the Global South\n\nBy Roli Srivastava\n\nAs COP29 wound up in the early hours of Sunday, India\u2019s fierce objection to the climate finance deal that was the summit\u2019s main outcome showed its resolve to act as a voice for the Global South in wanting more international support to step up climate action, diplomats and policy analysts said.\n\nIn a statement described as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201chistoric\u201d, India rejected the rushed approval of the new finance goal for 2026-2035, arguing that due process had not been followed, and sought \u201cmuch higher ambition\u201d from rich nations.\n\n\u201cThe Global South is being pushed to transit to no-carbon pathways even at the cost of our growth\u2026 other measures are being imposed by developed country parties to make this transition really not easy,\u201d Chandni Raina, an advisor with India\u2019s Department of Economic Affairs, said in an impassioned speech. \u201cThis amount is a paltry sum and not something that will enable conducive climate action,\u201d she said of the hard-fought deal on climate finance after it was gavelled through.\n\nRich nations on Saturday agreed to channel at least $300 billion a year by 2035 for developing countries to ramp up climate action, after bad-tempered talks in which the most vulnerable pushed for a bigger slice of the pie.\n\nThe new goal replaces the existing annual target of $100 billion, which was met two years late in 2022 and is widely seen as insufficient to meet rocketing needs among poorer nations for transitioning to clean energy and adapting to extreme weather and rising seas.\n\nIn Baku, poorer countries had pushed for that amount to be raised to at least $1 trillion, with most of the money provided as grants.\n\nThe far lower final offer of $300 billion, whose provision will be led by rich governments, is part of a wider effort agreed at COP29 to scale up finance to at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035 \u201cfrom all public and private sources\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed in the outcome which clearly brings out the unwillingness of the developed country parties to fulfill their responsibilities. We cannot accept it,\u201d Raina told the final plenary, drawing loud cheers. Delegates from Cuba, Nigeria, Malawi and Bolivia also outlined their disappointment and frustration after the decision had been approved.\n\nChampion for the Global South\n\n\u201cIt is important when India speaks up. It reflects our views \u2013 those of the least developed countries (LDCs),\u201d said Hana Hamadalla of Sudan, who was part of a delegation of least-developed countries that on Saturday walked out of consultations in protest at an earlier version of the deal.\n\nShe told Climate Home she found Raina\u2019s emphasis on the $300bn figure not being enough for poor nations to fight climate change \u201cto the point\u201d and reflective of Sudan\u2019s views.\n\n\u201cIndia has been and wants to continue to be a champion for other Global South developing countries,\u201d said Sandeep Pai, director for research and strategy at Swaniti Global, a social enterprise that works on climate action and policy.\n\nIn Baku, wealthy nations first put on the table an annual sum of $250 billion by 2035, which was rejected by climate campaigners and poor countries. They then increased their offer to $300 billion by that date. A high-level group of economists has recommended that level should be reached five years earlier and then raised to $390 billion a year by 2035.\n\nIndia, for its part, had called on rich nations to pledge $600 billion a year in grants. The final deal in Baku \u2013 half of that \u2013 did not specify how much of the core public finance goal should come as grants and cheap loans.\n\nPai described the COP29 finance deal as \u201cgrim\u201d. \u201cAt this point everyone knows money is not coming unless it is for something that would make sense commercially,\u201d he told Climate Home.\n\nWith Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president, the money will likely also be less than promised, Pai added, especially if the country withdraws from the Paris climate agreement as Trump has threatened to do.\n\nThat could leave a finance hole that European nations, Japan and other wealthy governments may be unwilling to fill, boosting pressure on richer, big-emitting developing countries to dig deeper.\n\nVoluntary contributions\n\nIndustrialised countries before and during COP pushed hard to expand the donor base for climate finance to include richer developing countries such as China and oil-rich Gulf states, a proposal fiercely rejected by India, the world\u2019s most populous nation.\n\n\u201cIndian negotiators are articulating a long-held stand, so they (wealthy nations) don\u2019t start counting India as a developed nation, expected to pay,\u201d said Pai.\n\nAnalysts said there had been no formal ask for India to join the contributor base for the new goal. But New Delhi has pushed back strongly against changes that could shift the parameters of the global climate agreements governing the negotiations, particularly those that could blur the line on who shoulders the greatest responsibility to act on climate change.\n\nThe final deal only \u201cencourages\u201d developing countries to make contributions to the new finance goal \u201con a voluntary basis\u201d.\n\nBut on Sunday, within hours of COP29 finally reaching a deal, Jennifer Morgan, Germany\u2019s special envoy for climate, posted a statement on X saying: \u201cWe stand to give more, if those who have grown significantly since 1992 \u2013 in wealth and emissions \u2013 are ready to step up as well. The target we have put forward demonstrates our seriousness.\u201d\n\nWhile China, the United States, India and the EU currently make up the world\u2019s largest emitters, India ranks lowest in terms of per-capita emissions, according to World Research Institute analysis. The United States and Russia have the highest per-capita emissions.\n\nIndia\u2019s Raina told the final CO29 plenary that developing countries are now being seen as contributors to finance climate action, and India was opposed to it.\n\nLess finance, weaker NDCs\n\nIn the negotiating rooms in Baku, India led the conversation on the NCQG from the Global South, and its opposition to the agreed goal could signal that developing countries may submit weak national climate plans (NDCs) next year, analysts warned.\n\nSanjay Vashist, director of Climate Action Network South Asia, said developing countries such as India may not slow down their efforts to adapt to climate shifts, but their actions and ambitions will not be reflected in the NDC they submit.\n\n\u201cWe are answerable to domestic monitoring systems not international. Now you are not under obligation,\u201d he said, referring to the shortfall in finance.\n\nIndia\u2019s strongly worded objection at COP29 was also regarded as significant because it sends a strong signal \u201cthat a deal cannot be done\u201d without countries being heard, said Srestha Banerjee, director of just transition at the International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology (iFOREST), a research and policy think-tank.\n\nThe critical voices, not just of India but also other countries including Colombia\u2019s environment minister, \u201cshould be a wake-up call for rethinking the UNFCCC [process] and how it can truly deliver cooperative action\u201d, Banerjee said.\n\n(Reporting by Roli Srivastava; editing by Megan Rowling)\n\nThis article was produced as part of the COP29 Cross-Border Energy Transition Reporting Fellowship, a programme organised by Clean Energy Wire and the Stanley Center for Peace and Security.",

According to a Reuters report, the ministry has issued an internal advisory on January 29, warning that the use of AI applications on office computers and devices presents risks to the security of sensitive government information. Three officials from India's finance ministry confirmed the authenticity of the advisory, the report added.This comes amid ongoing scrutiny of AI tools across various nations. Countries such as Australia and Italy have already implemented similar restrictions on the use of DeepSeek, citing data security concerns.The Indian finance ministry's advisory reads: \"It has been determined that AI tools and AI apps (such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, etc.) in office computers and devices pose risks for confidentiality of (government) data and documents.\"The ban on AI tools by government comes just ahead of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s planned visit to India today (February 5) where he is set to meet with the IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The visit comes amid India's ambitious push into artificial intelligence through its recently announced IndiaAI Mission, which has received a government allocation of Rs 10,371 crore over five years.The OpenAI chief's India stop is part of a broader international tour that includes Japan, South Korea, the UAE, Germany, and France. This marks Altman's second visit to India, following his June 2023 trip when he first met with PM Modi to discuss AI regulations. According to The Economic Times, Altman is also scheduled to meet with leading venture capital investors, including representatives from Peak XV Partners and Accel, during his Delhi visit.OpenAI has faced increasing scrutiny in India, including a high-profile copyright infringement case with leading media houses.

      "title": "IFC Partners with Axis Bank to Provide a $500 million Climate Loan in India",
      "content": "Loan to promote sustainable growth, create jobs and finance green/blue projects\n\nMumbai, October 7, 2024: The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group and the largest global development institution, is partnering with Axis Bank, one of the largest private sector banks in India, to provide a $500 million loan to help develop a blue finance market and scale up financing of green projects in India.\n\n\n\nThis is IFC\u2019s first blue investment in India and the first blue transaction by a financial institution in the country. Blue loans are financing instruments that raise and earmark funds for investments such as water and wastewater management, reduction of marine plastic pollution, restoration of marine ecosystems, sustainable shipping, eco-friendly tourism, and offshore renewable energy.\n\nThis transaction is also the largest green financing by IFC in the country. The funding will enable Axis Bank to expand its climate finance portfolio.\n\n\n\nWith India\u2019s rapid urbanization and economic growth, there is a substantial opportunity to enhance water and energy efficiency. The water and wastewater treatment market size was estimated at $1.6 billion as of 2022 and is expected to reach $3 billion by 2029. Additionally, the green buildings sector presents an investment opportunity of $1.4 trillion by 2030, driven by a need for sustainable infrastructure. Most of these investments need to come from the private sector to offset limited public funding.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Amitabh Chaudhry, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Axis Bank said, \u201cWith the increasing effects of climate change into the global ecosystem and the growing awareness of environment sustainability, it\u2019s imperative for banks to adopt sustainable lending practices. We are excited to partner with IFC with whom we share a common vision of strengthening standards and lending practices to boost sustainable finance in India. Given Axis Bank\u2019s focus on growing its climate and sustainable finance portfolios, along with its large size, systemic importance, and wide reach, we hope to be a strong and stable partner for IFC in the key focus area of climate finance in India.\u201d\n\n\"We are thrilled to announce our inaugural blue loan in India, marking our largest climate finance initiative in the country to date. India serves as an exceptional testing ground for innovative approaches to climate adaptation. This loan will not only catalyze private sector investment in this emerging asset class but also direct long-term funding toward fostering a sustainable blue economy. Additionally, it aims to enhance financing for climate projects across India, with a strong emphasis on green buildings that will mitigate climate change impacts and generate jobs. Partnering with Axis Bank, a like-minded ally, we are committed to propelling India\u2019s sustainable and inclusive growth forward,\u201d said Makhtar Diop, Managing Director of IFC.\n\nAxis Bank is among the first banks in India to have a board-approved Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) policy for lending that adheres to IFC Performance Standards. The Bank remains committed to supporting India\u2019s climate agenda with public commitment of incremental financing of Rs 60,000 crores (approximately $7.2 billion) in ESG-aligned sectors by 2030 (from August 2021), of which Rs 30,000 crores (approximately $3.1 billion) of incremental financing was achieved by March 2024.\n\nAxis Bank has been a pioneering issuer of sustainable instruments among Indian financial institutions. It issued Basel III additional tier I bonds in 2021 and senior green bonds in 2016. The bank, with a long-standing history of being a pioneer in sustainable financing, will use IFC\u2019s financing to promote resource-efficient growth and to create jobs, while protecting the critical clean water resources and supporting the nation\u2019s climate goals.\n\nAs part of its advisory services, IFC will support Axis Bank in growing its green buildings portfolio, including for affordable housing projects and building capacity for impact reporting. Through this engagement, IFC aims to catalyze the green buildings\u2019 market in India. IFC will also provide a performance-based incentive of up to $2.9 million from the UK-IFC Market Accelerator for Green Construction (MAGC) program aimed at supporting the design and construction of green buildings certified by IFC\u2019s EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) green buildings standard.\n\nIFC has built a successful track record in the green finance market and is laying the groundwork for launching and scaling blue finance across the globe. Since 2020, IFC has provided more than $1.9 billion dollars in blue loans and bonds to private institutions around the world.",

      "content": "NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Saturday that coordinated fiscal and monetary actions by govt and RBI will help boost consumption and there are initial signs of a good order book for the first quarter of the next fiscal year, which will help boost private investment.\"After the budget, the few inputs I have received from some business leaders is that the orders for fast-moving consumer goods for April-June are already getting booked, and the industry is clearly seeing signs of a possible recovery of consumption,\" she told reporters after addressing the RBI board.As a result, many companies are looking at reviewing their capacity utilisation, she said, adding that the triggers for a consumption-driven cycle are clearly being felt by those who have to decide on investments.\"So, I see this as a positive sign and with yesterday's (Friday's) decision of RBI, together things can move in alignment and the required traction we made in this course,\" FM said, while promising to work in coordination with the central bank just as was the case even during Covid-19.In the budget, FM announced income tax relief of Rs 1 lakh crore, while on Friday, RBI cut repo rates by 25 basis points, a first in five years.With the rupee weakening against the dollar and the central bank ending up sucking out liquidity as it sought to guard against excessive volatility, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra sought to assure market players saying that it would be \"watchful and agile\" in responding to the requirements and will \"use all tools available\".\"We will be very, very watchful, alert and very nimble and agile in whatever are the requirements of the banking system to provide liquidity, both transient, overnight, as well as more durable liquidity,\" he said.The governor said a large part of the depreciation of the rupee was driven by global uncertainty, especially US President Donald Trump's stand, and that should be out of the way soon. \"Hopefully that should settle down and that should help us in the downward movement of inflation,\" he said.He also made it clear that there was no change in the policy on exchange rate and that RBI is not targeting any price band for the rupee and focusing on curbing excess volatility. While assuming the exchange rate at 87 to a dollar, Malhotra said that a 5% depreciation in the rupee resulted in a 30-35 basis point inflation in the domestic market and added that RBI had factored it into its calculations.",

      "title": "Morning Bid: India eyes historic rate cut, global easing momentum mounts",
      "content": "By Jamie McGeever\n\n(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\n\nInvestors are anticipating India's first interest rate cut in nearly five years on Friday, which would be the latest move from major central banks around the world that points to a renewed desire to loosen policy and lower borrowing costs.\n\nThe obvious exceptions are the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has paused its easing cycle, and the Bank of Japan, which is gradually raising rates, albeit from virtually zero.\n\nBut the Reserve Bank of India's decision comes amid growing concern worldwide over the potential damage to economic activity and growth from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats.\n\nThe Bank of England and Bank of Mexico cut interest rates on Thursday, and there was an element of dovish surprise to both - the BoE's decision to lower rates by 25 basis points was expected but two policymakers voted to cut 50 bps, while Banxico said its 50 bps cut could be repeated at future meetings.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields, meanwhile, have fallen below 4.50% as worries about U.S. growth bubble up again, and a soft employment report on Friday will bring 4.00% closer into view than 5.00%.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the Reserve Bank of India to cut its key repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% in Governor Sanjay Malhotra's first monetary policy review, as it attempts to shore up flagging growth.\n\nIndia isn't in Trump's immediate line of protectionist fire but policymakers won't be complacent. India's trade surplus with the US has doubled in five years to the current $45 billion, and the rupee's persistent weakness ties the RBI's hands in the event of further tariff-led appreciation of the dollar.\n\nThe rupee is one of the worst-performing emerging currencies against the dollar this year, trading at an all-time low below 87.00 per dollar. A rate cut is widely expected so it should be in the rupee's price, leaving all eyes on the new governor's guidance.\n\nAsia's economic calendar on Friday includes foreign exchange reserves from several countries including China, inflation data from Taiwan and, perhaps more importantly in the current climate, January trade figures from Taiwan also.\n\nTaiwan's trade deficit with the US last year widened to $74 billion, meaning it has virtually quadrupled in six years.\n\nTaiwan said this week it will support companies that plan to relocate to the United States, including helping them find partners. Taiwan is home to chipmaker TSMC, which has a $65 billion investment in the US to build factories in Arizona.\n\nStory Continues",

Credit: Abhiram Juvvadi\n\nWharton students and faculty gathered for a fireside chat with Nirmala Sitharaman, India's Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, at Huntsman Hall on Oct. 22.\n\nThe event was co-hosted by the Wharton Initiative on Financial Policy and Regulation and the Wharton India Economic Forum. The conversation, which attracted over 100 attendees, was moderated by Howard Butcher III Professor of Finance Joao Gomes, and Joseph J. Aresty Professor and Executive Director of the Wharton-Indian School of Business Program Jagmohan Raju.\n\nSitharaman, an influential figure in global finance and Indian politics, shared insights into India\u2019s economy and the transformative policies that have positioned the nation on a global stage. Her tenure as Minister of Finance, beginning in 2019, and her leadership in various other portfolios \u2014 including her role as India's first full-time female Minister of Defence \u2014 have made her a key player in shaping the country\u2019s financial and corporate strategies.\n\nThe minister discussed India's path to a developed nation by 2047. She highlighted the four \u201cI\u2019s\u201d \u2014 infrastructure, investment, innovation, and inclusiveness \u2014 as key to India's path toward becoming a developed nation.\n\n\u201cIndia is at a very critical juncture when you look at the ways India has to move forward,\u201d she said to the audience. \u201cWe have set ourselves a destination of becoming a developed nation in 2047.\u201d\n\nDuring the fireside chat, Sitharaman discussed how India's digital public infrastructure is rising, particularly through advancements in financial technologies. The minister emphasized how the Indian government\u2019s policies are designed to promote long-term growth and inclusivity, with specific attention to the role technology plays in economic development. She also discussed the benefits of the Ayushman Bharat Scheme, calling it one of the best social security programs.\n\n\u201cToday, India wouldn't have been the fastest growing economy if the people hadn't utilized the digital infrastructure, which was available to them at free of cost,\u201d Sitharaman told the audience. \u201cIt reached the people through various campaigns & awareness programmes even in their own local languages.\u201d\n\nWharton first year Sidhya Ganesh expressed her excitement about being in the same room as the finance minister.\n\n\u201cGetting to be in the same room as Shrimati Nirmala Sitharaman was truly an incredible experience,\u201d Ganesh said. \u201cIndia has truly been all the buzz recently with hosting the first-ever G20 summit in India and really just growing globally and massively in terms of economy, innovation, and entrepreneurship amongst youth.\u201d\n\nSecond-year bioengineering graduate student Yeshwanth Mahesh commended Sitharaman\u2019s authoritative presence and insightful perspectives.\n\nSign up for our newsletter Get our newsletter, DP Daybreak, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning. Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHer thoughts on the global economy were truly impressive, and her responses to the questions from both faculty and students really highlighted her command over the issues,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to discussing India\u2019s economic growth, Sitharaman also highlighted the importance of student involvement in global finance. She encouraged Penn students to consider internships and research opportunities within India\u2019s finance sector.\n\nSitharaman\u2019s visit to Wharton came as part of her larger agenda, which includes meetings at the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group, G20 Meeting of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, and bilateral meetings in Mexico and USA.\n\nThe Daily Pennsylvanian is an independent, student-run newspaper.

      "content": "Finance Ministry has asked its employees to avoid using AI tools such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek for official purposes because of the risks these chatbots pose to the confidentiality of government documents and data, Reuters reported, citing an internal department advisory.\n\nAlso Read | AI security threat? Australia removes DeepSeek from government devices\n\n\u201cIt has been determined that AI tools and AI apps (such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek etc.) in the office computers and devices pose risks for confidentiality of (government) data and documents,\u201d the Reuters report quoted the advistory as saying.\n\nWhile the notification is reportedly dated January 29, news of its existence coincides with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's trip to India. Altman is expected to meet IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.\n\nIndia's plans to build its own AI: Last week, Vaishnaw responded to DeepSeek's recent surge in popularity by announcing India's plans to enter the global AI race with its own foundational model.\n\n\u201cThe foundational models made in India will be able to compete with the best of the best in the world\u2026 With algorithmic efficiency, we can create these models in a much shorter time frame. We will have a world-class foundational AI model in just a few months.\u201d the Union Minister had said then.\n\nThe Electronics and IT minister had also stated then that the data privacy issues surrounding DeepSeek could be addressed by hosting open source models on Indian servers.\n\nDeepSeek faces global scrutiny: Last week, Dutch privacy watchdog AP announced that it was launching an investigation into DeepSeek's privacy policies, specifically how the app uses users' personal information.\n\nSince its sudden rise in popularity, DeepSeek has come under increasing scrutiny from regulators around the world over its privacy policies. The Chinese app has already been banned in Italy after failing to satisfy privacy concerns raised by the country's data protection authority.",

Our primary objective is to maintain stability,\" he said.\n\n\"But of course, we would have incorporated all the amendments that we did in this law,\" he said.\n\nPandey said that the new income tax bill is not trying to attempt a new thing, but it will be a different way of engagement with citizens.\n\n\"Laws are not supposed to be only meant for legal professionals. They are also meant for the citizens to understand,\" he added.\n\nThe Union Cabinet is set to approve the bill in the coming days, paving the way for its introduction in the Lok Sabha, which many are expecting as early as next week.\n\nThe bill is part of a broader initiative to reform the tax system, aiming to streamline and enhance transparency in the existing structure.",

      "content": "A US military plane carrying Indian illegal immigrants landed in the northern Indian city of Amritsar on Wednesday , handcuffed and legs chained throughout the journey. Unlike Colombia , which last month initially refused to accept deportees dispatched in military planes like criminals, India chose discretion as the better part of valour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was not a particularly proud moment for a major US ally and rising power whose leader is supposedly a close friend of the new US president, but India is doing all it can to withstand the aftershock of Donald Trump \u2019s second coming.\n\nLast week, the tremors were felt in India\u2019s annual budget presentation in parliament, one of the country\u2019s most awaited government events. As Trump unleashed new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, the Narendra Modi government cut customs duties on high-end motorcycles, cars and smartphone parts.\n\nThe tax reduction will help American companies like Harley-Davidson, Tesla and Apple , earning the government some urgently needed brownie points with Washington. Indian tariffs on Harley-Davidson, in particular, had been an old Trump peeve . The last time he was president, he forced Modi to slash tariffs on Harleys from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. This time Delhi isn\u2019t taking any chances.\n\nA Harley-Davidson motorcycle is seen on display at an expo in New Delhi in 2012. Photo: EPA-EFE\n\nThe fear is palpable. Not just pre-emptive tariff cuts, Modi\u2019s government has been bending over backwards to get on the right side of the new US administration in every other way \u2013 from assuring it of India\u2019s commitment to the primacy of the US dollar to accepting 18,000 illegal Indian immigrants Trump plans to send back.\n\nAdvertisement",

      "title": "Opposition parties must speak up for Modi critics, says Indian-American politician Kshama Sawant",
      "content": "Kshama Sawant, an Indian-American politician and a critic of India\u2019s Hindu Right, has \u201curged\u201d the country\u2019s political Opposition to speak up for critics like her, saying it is in their interest to do so.\n\nIn a virtual interview to The Hindu, Ms. Sawant referred to the \u201ccomplete inability of the political opposition to put forward a unified agenda for the working people, not just in India, but globally. And this is what has led to the election of (Donald) Trump (in the U.S.) and (Narendra) Modi (in India).\u201d\n\nAlso read: Kshama Sawant visa rejection: Sawant alleges physical assault at Indian consulate in Seattle\n\n\u201cI would urge India\u2019s political opposition to speak up for those like me, Ashok Swain, Avani Dias, and other Modi critics being denied a visa,\u201d Ms. Sawant, whose visa application to visit her ailing mother in Bengaluru, was denied twice in 2024. She said that the Opposition parties should come together to state that they would not support \u201can inhumane agenda where Indian citizens, like my mother, are not allowed to meet their own families\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have not had such an outcry from the political opposition,\u201d Ms. Sawant, a former City Council Member of Seattle, said.\n\nAshok Swain is a Sweden-based professor of Indian origin, whose Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked in July 2023 for \u201cindulging in activities inimical to the sovereignty and integrity of India\u201d. Avani Dias is the former South Asia Bureau Chief of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, who left India in April 2024, citing a denial of visa extension for her reporting on the run-up to the General Election in India, a statement that has been contested by the Modi government.\n\n\u201cWe must remember that this is happening at a time when the Trump administration has been passing extreme anti-immigrant executive orders. This was evident from the 104 Indians without proper documents being shackled and sent back on a U.S. military plane. We must remember that Trump rode to power with promises of mass deportation like these and letting loose a whole series of workplace raids. So, there\u2019s a chill, but there\u2019s an utter failure on the part of the Democratic party on speaking up against these measures. And it\u2019s a similar case in India,\u201d Ms. Sawant said.\n\nMs. Sawant\u2019s mother, 82-year-old Vasundhara Ramanujam, is a retired school teacher. She lives with Ms. Sawant\u2019s older sister in Bengaluru. Ms. Vasundhara has been diagnosed with ischemic heart disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and a range of other debilitating illnesses, says the letter by her doctor seen by The Hindu. The letter was attached along with Ms. Sawant and her husband Calvin Priest\u2019s emergency visa application three weeks ago. \u201cEmergency visas are granted within days, but we have not received any response till now. While my husband was granted visas during the past two applications, no reason was stated for the denial of my visa. What else is this, but political retaliation?,\u201d Ms. Sawant asked. Ms. Sawant said she is exploring a legal challenge to her visa denial, but hasn\u2019t begun the process yet.\n\nAfter serving a decade on the Seattle City Council, Ms. Sawant established a political organisation \u2014 Workers Strike Back, advocating for a federal minimum wage of $25 an hour, unionising labour in big Tech, to tap into what she calls \u201cpent-up frustration against the Democratic Party\u201d for supporting big businesses. She gained notoriety early on in her career with the successful implementing a $15 an hour minimum wage in 2014 for the city of Seattle. This rose to $20.76 an hour this year, the highest minimum wage in the U.S. The federal minimum wage \u2014 $7.25 an hour \u2014 has remained unchanged since July 2009.\n\nMs. Sawant successfully rallied to pass a slew of resolutions against measures by the Modi government, like the Citizenship Amendment Act in February 2020, setting a precedent for other cities to follow. On February 21, 2023, Seattle became the first U.S. city to ban caste discrimination, through a city council legislation, a measure championed by Ms. Sawant.\n\n\u201cWhat did people like Pramila Jayapal and Ro Khanna (Democratic Congressional leaders from Washington and California respectively) from the Indian diaspora do to fight the Trump agenda? They stayed silent,\u201d Ms. Sawant alleged. Blaming liberal politicians in the U.S. and in India for the Right wing tilt in both countries, Ms. Sawant said, \u201cit is in their interest to win ordinary people back.\u201d\n\nShe blamed the liberal parties\u2019 abdication of their role as a voice for the working people and their support for the \u201cbillionaire class\u201d, both in India and the U.S., which has led to the citizens of these countries voting for Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi. \u201cThere is no viable opposition,\u201d Ms. Sawant said, \u201cthe only way out is an independent working-class movement.\u201d",

      "title": "INDIA allies sharpening knives, Congress\u2019s \u2018all about AAP\u2019 claim may not cut much ice",
      "content": "Delhi has fallen finally and the INDIA bloc is at the crossroads again. The euphoria that was seen in the Opposition camp after the BJP\u2019s Lok Sabha setback \u2013 already on the wane after the Haryana and Maharashtra results \u2013 is all but dissipated. The big question before the alliance Saturday was how to hit refresh.\n\nAs expected, the knives are out in the Opposition camp, with some in the INDIA bloc openly blaming the Congress. The official position of the Congress, which personally expects to gain in Delhi from the Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s (AAP\u2019s) defeat, was that it was not the party\u2019s responsibility to help the AAP win.\n\nThe Delhi election results \u201creflect nothing more than a referendum on Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party\u201d, the Congress said, choosing largely to deflect the fact that its vote share crawled barely 2 per cent up to 6.34 per cent this time. Incidentally, that was nearly the same gap between the BJP and AAP.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThis would hardly escape the attention of INDIA parties, particularly as the answer as to how to stop the BJP and the Narendra Modi bandwagon continues to escape them.\n\nSlogans like \u201cthe Constitution is in danger\u201d and that \u201cinstitutions are being captured\u201d, which the Congress led with, clearly did not excite the people.\n\nAdditionally, the Congress and AAP\u2019s now-on, now-off partnership inspired little confidence among them, said a senior Congress leader, a tinge of anguish in his voice. \u201cOur top leaders addressed a public meeting in Delhi along with INDIA bloc leaders to protest against the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal in March last year. We fought the Lok Sabha elections together. And now we are fighting against each other,\u201d the leader said.\n\nBJP workers celebrate election results at the Delhi BJP office in New Delhi. (Express Photo by Praveen Khanna) BJP workers celebrate election results at the Delhi BJP office in New Delhi. (Express Photo by Praveen Khanna)\n\nEven on Saturday, the confusion within the Congress over the AAP was evident. Many Congress leaders said in private that now that it had lost, the volunteer-driven AAP would collapse and wither away, and presumably the Congress votes the AAP had taken would return to it.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nCongress communication head Jairam Ramesh asserted there will be a Congress government in Delhi in 2030. Noting that the AAP had won decisively in Delhi even at the height of Modi\u2019s popularity in 2015 and 2020, Ramesh said: \u201cThis shows that, rather than being vindication of the policies of the PM, this vote is a rejection of Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s politics of deceit, deception, and vastly exaggerated claims of achievement.\u201d\n\nPriyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is on a three-day tour of her Kerala constituency, said: \u201cPeople were fed up with the way things were and they wanted change\u2026 For the rest of us, it just means we have to work harder.\u201d\n\nRahul Gandhi thanked the party\u2019s workers and voters, and posted: \u201cWe humbly accept the mandate of Delhi\u2026 This fight for the progress of Delhi and the rights of Delhiites \u2013 against pollution, inflation and corruption \u2013 will continue.\u201d\n\nHowever, many in the INDIA bloc were reluctant to cut the Congress any slack. Senior Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav, who told The Indian Express in an interview before the results that the Congress was behind the Opposition\u2019s failure to dislodge the Modi government, said that the Centre put enough hurdles in the path of the AAP administration in Delhi to make it stumble. However, he asked, why was the Congress campaign targeted at the AAP.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe attitude of the Congress was very bad. I can understand the Congress attacking the BJP and seeking votes. But they attacked Kejriwal more, thinking that they can come back once Kejriwal is knocked down,\u201d Ram Gopal told The Indian Express.\n\nCPI general secretary D Raja, who is generally more gentle on the Congress, said: \u201cThis result clearly highlights that the RSS-BJP\u2019s divisive agenda can only be effectively countered through a united, ideological and political front\u2026 It is a wake-up call for the constituents of the INDIA bloc, particularly the Congress \u2013 the largest party in the coalition \u2013 and other dominant regional parties.\u201d\n\nThe path forward, Raja said, requires \u201chonest, self-critical introspection to strengthen the unity necessary for the defence of our Constitution and pro-people policies\u201d.\n\nTo charges that it didn\u2019t align with the AAP, the Congress has been arguing that it was the AAP which did not want an alliance with it, and that Kejriwal himself spelt that out clearly with the AAP first off the block announcing all its 70 candidates.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe meltdown of a section of so-called liberals is completely bizarre. They didn\u2019t give these lectures on opposition unity to AAP when the party went to Goa, Gujarat, Haryana etc to fight elections and weaken the anti-communal, secular vote. Delhi election result is a rejection of the Trojan horse that attempted to damage the liberal cause across the country. The majority of liberals are rightly cheering the fall of the facade so that the real champion of liberal values \u2013 the Indian National Congress \u2013 can emerge stronger to take the BJP,\u201d Congress leader Pawan Khera said.\n\nThe RJD\u2019s Manoj Kumar Jha also raised similar points while arguing that the outcome in Delhi was \u201cepisodic\u201d as the people may have yearned for change.\n\nWith Bihar elections, where the INDIA unity under the RJD will be tested, up next, Jha said not much should be read into the Congress and AAP not joining hands. \u201cEven the Congress can complain that the AAP fought against them in Goa, Gujarat, Haryana\u2026 This is all part of larger democratic processes\u2026 But overall, the idea of the INDIA bloc was at the Central level, which is an idea to provide an alternative to the BJP. That remains relevant,\u201d Jha said, adding that \u201cparties have to sit together and plan for the future\u201d.\n\nAmong the first INDIA bloc leaders to comment on the results was Jammu and Kashmir CM and National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah, who put out a cryptic post on X: \u201cAur lado aapas mein (Just keep on fighting)!!!\u201d\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nCongress ally in Kerala Indian Union Muslim League rued that differences in the INDIA bloc paved the way for the BJP\u2019s good show. \u201cEveryone in the alliance should discuss this matter,\u201d veteran IUML leader P K Kunhalikutty said.\n\nThe Trinamool Congress, facing a tough contest against the BJP in 2025 and a strong advocate of the AAP, however, preferred silence on Saturday.\n\nAlong with the SP, TMC had sent leaders to campaign for the AAP in Delhi.\n\nTMC chief Mamata Banerjee\u2019s claim to the INDIA bloc leadership is set to again come into focus after the results, as questions rise over the Congress. Several INDIA parties believe the Congress has failed to take along everyone or to give a direction to the bloc.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nHowever, Mamata\u2019s way to leadership of the alliance won\u2019t be smooth. While parties like the SP, RJD and Shiv Sena (UBT) are in favour of the TMC chief taking the reins, the DMK and NCP (SP) are yet to reveal their cards. Given the close ties between Rahul Gandhi and DMK president and Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin, the DMK is expected to side with the Congress.\n\nThe Left parties, staunch opponents of Mamata in Bengal, would never back any proposal to anoint the TMC chief as the INDIA bloc head.\n\nAmong the non-NDA, non-INDIA bloc parties, the Bharat Rashtra Samithi also took a swipe at the Congress. BRS working president K T Rama Rao \u201ccongratulated\u201d posted: \u201cCongrats to Rahul Gandhi for winning the election for BJP, yet again! Well done.\u201d",

      "title": "Why Kejriwal's hubris was both bad politics and economics",
      "content": "Delhi: 'Magic In Mustafabad'; BJP Win In Muslim-Dominated Seat Powered By Owaisi?\n\nPoll How Do You View the Delhi Election Results? A Reflection of Voter Sentiment A Major Political Shift\n\nThe Delhi election results , which have brought BJP back to government after 27 years, can be summed up in one line: the aam aadmi voted against the leadership of Aam Aadmi Party , but not necessarily against the idea of AAP. There can be no other explanation when many top leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, who made this election a referendum on himself, lost their seats - but the drop in AAP's seat count was not mirrored in a commensurate drop in vote share, which came within a stone's throw of BJP's.BJP proved that an elephant can dance. It was nimble enough to finetune strategy to make the Delhi election both local and national. Congress, in order to keep its own political future safe from intruders, marginally helped by making the defeat of Kejriwal a higher priority than defeating BJP.If there is one thing politicians can learn from the AAP debacle, it is to eschew hubris and over-ambition. BJP got a taste of the blowback from cockiness in Lok Sabha elections, but it wasn't a crippling blow. Now Kejriwal has faced a full electoral backlash and is out of government in Delhi, his launchpad to national fame.Kejriwal lost for two major reasons apart from hubris. One, thanks to the liquor scandal and the spending of large sums on his official residence, the electorate saw that the man they voted for (a pro-poor, anti-corruption crusader) may not be who he claimed to be. It's no crime for a CM to have a reasonably well-equipped residence, but it went against Kejriwal's well-cultivated image of living the life of aam aadmi. He made things worse for himself by, among other things, making wild allegations about Haryana trying to poison Delhi's waters. No voter likes to see his future CM sounding a bit unhinged.BJP, for its part, sought to consolidate the middle-class vote - Delhi is India's predominant middle-class city - without losing other segments. The budget's tax sops helped.Delhi has two attributes that contribute to political hubris. As the national capital, anyone who runs it gets national attention. Secondly, as a city-state with high revenues but only some of the costs of running a state, it gives you the freedom to use these resources to offer endless freebies to get yourself elected. Unlike regular states, Delhi doesn't have to pay for policing and pensions, two very big expenditure areas for most states.Kejriwal misused these advantages. He used the revenue surpluses (now largely gone) for freebies and self-promotion, spending hundreds of crores to build his image in other states, by issuing front-page print and primetime television ads. Why does a man running a prosperous city-state need to spend its taxpayers' money elsewhere?Hubris began immediately after the thumping 2015 assembly victory, where his party won 67 of Delhi's 70 seats. Kejriwal began to see himself as a potential PM and used Delhi's resources to project himself in that light. In Delhi, he held no portfolios, leaving the actual job of running his administration to Manish Sisodia and other ministerial colleagues. Clearly, his focus was less on doing a mayoral job in Delhi, and more on his next move up the national political ladder.For someone without Kejriwal's over-ambition, Delhi's high revenues could have been used for really improving the state of primary and secondary education and basic healthcare. And, initially, this was indeed his party's focus and some real change appears to have begun in these areas. But it wasn't carried through to becoming a viable model fit for replication elsewhere. The Kejriwal model didn't prove useful to anyone, except to make free power and water the basic poll prepayment required for any party to win an election. These questionable ideas were used to win the Punjab assembly election, but that state does not have the resources to sustain such freebies endlessly and is now deep in debt.Kejriwal also played his politics poorly, losing allies along the way. He saw himself as the national alternative to BJP and Modi, when this could have been possible only at the expense of Congress, which governs much larger states than Delhi. This contributed to his election loss, as Congress realised that AAP was a threat to its national stature and sought to undercut it.The Delhi defeat should bring Kejriwal down to earth. If he really introspects, he will emerge a much better politician. He should first do the hard job of making his policies and potential known beyond Delhi without using freebies as his only calling card. He has the political savvy to bounce back but only if he abandons hubris. Contrary to his own assumptions, he is not - yet - God's gift to India. AAP still has brand salience but he squandered it this time.For BJP, the test of good governance begins now. If any state could do with a double-engine sarkar, it's the half-state of Delhi.",

      "content": "Indian-American politician Kshama Sawant, an outspoken critic of the Narendra Modi-led government and its policies, hit the headlines on Friday after she and members of her outfit protested at the Indian consulate in Seattle on being denied an emergency visa to visit her ailing mother in Bengaluru. The incident soon blew out of proportion as the Indian consulate tweeted about \"unauthorised entry by certain individuals\" while Sawant, in multiple posts, accused the officials of physical assault.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the row lies the denial of an emergency visa to Sawant, a former Seattle City Council member. However, her husband was issued a visa. She claimed that it was the third time that a visa was denied to her to visit her 82-year- old mother as her name was on a \"reject list\".\n\nNOW: Kshama Sawant and members of Workers Strike Back are engaging in a peaceful sit-in at the Consulate of India in Seattle, demanding answers for why @cmkshama\u2019s visa has been denied a third time, and why she has been told that the Modi government has placed her on a \u201creject... pic.twitter.com/a7nZk7HUeL \u2014 Workers Strike Back (@wrkrsstrikeback) February 7, 2025\n\nIn a lengthy post on X, the activist, known to be involved in anti-India lobbying activities, blamed PM Modi and the BJP government over the issue. In the past, she had publicly spoken out against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the farmers' protests.\n\nWHO IS KSHAMA SAWANT?\n\nadvertisement\n\nBorn in Pune, Kshama Sawant completed her bachelor's from the University of Mumbai in 1994. She then moved to the United States and pursued a doctorate in economics from North Carolina State University, graduating in 2003.\n\nFor three years, she worked as a lecturer and professor of economics before dabbling in politics. In 2006, she joined a US-based political party called Socialist Alternative. Even though her bid to enter the Washington House of Representatives in 2012 failed, she was elected to the Seattle City Council the next year.\n\nShe became famous after helping push through legislation that made it mandatory to grant a minimum wage of $15 an hour in Seattle.\n\nHowever, it is her criticisms of the Indian government and Hinduphobic remarks that have rankled a section of Indian Americans and community leaders.\n\nIn 2023, Sawant got a resolution passed in the Seattle council outlawing caste discrimination - the first US city to do so. Sawant, however, faced heavy criticism from Hindu Americans, who claimed that the move singles out the Hindu community which is already vulnerable to discrimination in the US.\n\nIn 2020, she got a resolution passed in the Seattle City Council denouncing the CAA and NRC for \"discriminating against women, Muslims, members of suppressed castes, indigenous and LGBT individuals\".\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile the CAA allows certain religious minorities from India's neighbouring countries to become permanent citizens, the NRC aims to identify illegal immigrants in the country.\n\nAmid the visa denial row, Sawant has started an online petition demanding that India grant her a visa. She has also hinted at legal action.",

Parliament's proceedings were adjourned Thursday as the lawmakers chanted slogans and demanded a discussion about the deportation.\n\nRenuka Chowdhury, a lawmaker in the Congress party, said the deportees were \"handcuffed, had their legs chained and even struggled to use the washroom.\"\n\nHer colleague, Gaurav Gogoi, called it \"degrading.\"\n\nParliament Speaker Om Birla tried to calm the lawmakers, saying the transportation of the deportees was a matter of U.S. foreign policy and that the U.S. \"also has its own rules and regulations.\"\n\nOne deportee, Jaspal Singh, said their handcuffs and leg chains were taken off only at the Amritsar airport in India.\n\nSingh, 36, said they initially thought they were being taken to another camp in the U.S and only found out about their deportation once on the plane. \"The flight was into 8-9 hours and an officer informed (us) that we are being deported\" to India, he said.\n\nThe U.S. government usually carries out deportations on commercial and chartered flights. The use of the U.S. military to return people to their home country is a relatively new method that started under the Trump administration.\n\nOpposition lawmakers, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, also protested outside the Parliament as they demanded a response from the government. Some wore handcuffs and carried placards that read: \"Humans, not prisoners.\"\n\n\"Indians deserve Dignity and Humanity, NOT Handcuffs,\" Gandhi wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nHe uploaded a video showing another deportee, Harvinder Singh, as saying they were handcuffed and their feet chained for 40 hours. \"We were not allowed to move an inch from our seats. It was worse than hell,\" he said.\n\nLater Thursday, India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told the Parliament's upper house that U.S. regulations allow for the use of restraints since 2012, both on military and civilian flights. He said the U.S. authorities have informed them that women and children are not restrained.\n\n\"There has been no change, I repeat, no change, from past procedure for the flight undertaken by the U.S.\" on Wednesday, he said.\n\nJaishankar said while the government was engaging the U.S. authorities to \"ensure that the returning deportees are not mistreated,\" India's focus should be on the crackdown on the illegal migration.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to visit Washington next week. President Donald Trump and Modi discussed immigration in a phone call last week and Trump stressed the importance of India buying more American-made security equipment and fair bilateral trade.\n\nA spokesperson at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi said enforcing immigration laws was critical for the country's national security and public safety.\n\n\"It is the policy of the United States to faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens,\" Christopher Elms said.\n\nNew Delhi says it opposes illegal immigration, mainly because it is linked to several forms of organized crime, and it has not objected to the U.S. deporting its citizens.\n\nRecent years have seen a jump in the number of Indians attempting to enter the U.S. along the U.S.-Canada border. The U.S. Border Patrol arrested more than 14,000 Indians on the Canadian border in the year ending Sept. 30, which amounted to 60% of all arrests along that border and more than 10 times the number two years ago.\n\nMedia reports indicate that Indians living in the U.S. without papers are mainly from Punjab and Gujarat states. Indians accounted for about 3% of all illegal border crossings in the U.S. in 2024.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier this week the deportation flights were an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, which he said is destructive and destabilizing.\n\nThe State Department said such deportations deter other people considering migrating illegally.\n\nJaishankar, India's External Affairs Minister, told Parliament that 15,668 Indian nationals have been deported back to India from the U.S. since 2009.\n\nA Pew Research Center report said that as of 2022, India ranked third \u2014 after Mexico and El Salvador \u2014 on the list of countries with the largest number of unauthorized immigrants \u2014 725,000 \u2014 living in the U.S.",

      "title": "Kshama Sawant alleges political vendetta as India denies her visa, clears husband's",
      "content": "Indian-American politician and former Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant has alleged that the Indian government has denied her an emergency visa to visit her ailing mother in India. Sawant stated that her application was rejected without explanation, while her husband, Calvin Priest, was granted a visa without any issue.\n\nIn a statement on social media platform X, Sawant revealed that the Indian consulate informed her she was on a \"reject list\" and refused to provide further details. She also claimed that officials at the consulate threatened to call the police when she refused to leave the premises.\n\nSawant's 82-year-old mother, Vasundhara Ramanujam, has been undergoing treatment for multiple serious health conditions, including atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease. With her mother\u2019s health deteriorating rapidly, Sawant has been making urgent appeals for visa approval, but her applications have been denied twice since May 2024, she told TNM earlier.\n\nSawant has attributed the visa denial to political retaliation by the Indian government, citing her strong opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s policies. In 2020, she introduced a resolution in the Seattle City Council condemning India's Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which were widely criticized for their exclusionary policies.\n\nShe has played a key role in the movement against caste-based discrimination in the United States. In 2023, under her leadership, Seattle became the first city in the U.S. to officially recognize caste as a protected category, ensuring legal protection for marginalized caste groups against discrimination.\n\nDespite her repeated requests for an emergency visa, Indian authorities have remained firm in their decision, fueling speculation that the rejection is politically motivated.\n\nSawant is not the only critic of the Modi government facing such difficulties. Sweden-based professor Ashok Swain, another vocal opponent, is still fighting the cancellation of his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card, effectively barring him from re-entering the country. Like Sawant, Swain has an elderly mother in need of medical attention. The Indian government has reportedly accused him of engaging in \"illegal activities inimical\" to the country\u2019s sovereignty and security, a charge he has denied.",

      "content": "Delhi is a city-state with limited powers for whoever runs its state government but the verdict on Saturday has the potential to influence national politics more than what Haryana and Maharashtra state polls did last year giving a fillip to the BJP after its unexpected setback in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nHaryana and Maharashtra both showed the BJP\u2019s remarkable ability to bounce back \u2013 indeed, this has kept its allies on the party\u2019s right side and now there is a buzz that a group from the Shiv Sena (UBT) may soon join the NDA. But Delhi\u2019s ripple effect travels beyond the BJP getting control of one more state.\n\nThe party has wrested Delhi after 27 long years of sustained political effort \u2013 first against Sheila Dikshit when she was in power for 15 years between 1998-2013, then from Arvind Kejriwal who defeated her in 2013 and swept Delhi in 2015 and 2020, even as Narendra Modi managed to win 7/7 seats in the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 and 2024 general elections.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nPeople wanted Modi for India and Kejriwal for Delhi. This has now changed.\n\nDelhi signals that despite the setback Modi suffered in 2024, his popularity remains intact. There was no other leader the BJP relied on in Delhi as it did on Modi, in what was a virtual referendum on AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal. Delhi is also a message to the international community \u2014 the representatives of world capitals, international media and the multiple agencies which have a presence here \u2014that they will have to deal with a stronger rather than a weaker PM.\n\nThis comes when Trumpism poses new challenges to many countries, including India, with trade wars in the offing and images of illegal migrants being deported, shackled and chained.\n\nThe two-thirds majority that the BJP has notched up in Delhi \u2014 up from eight to 48 \u2014 with its vote share up by an impressive around 7 percentage points and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) losing 10 percentage points in its vote share shows a ground-level mood for change. Clearly, the party has the support of virtually all sections \u2014 and not just the middle-class which was disenchanted with the AAP, and turned towards the BJP.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThis, too, is bound to have a ripple effect for Delhi is not just a cosmopolitan hub but also a city of migrants: Punjabis who settled here after Partition and formed the mainstay of the BJP in the early years, Purvanchalis (around 30% today) who have come from UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, or communities like the Valmikis amongst the Dalits, or the Jats, or most importantly, the women who had solidly stood by AAP in the last two elections but now seem to have moved.\n\nDelhi could be a trendsetter indicating that what matters to voters today, especially in cities, may not be just \u201cfreebies\u201d, important as they are for the poorer sections. As to the middle class, so also to the jhuggi jhopdi dwellers, other issues are getting greater traction: the right to breathe unpolluted air or the right to drink clean water, not to have to spend hours navigating traffic snarls or travel over potholed roads day after day, or be surrounded by mounds of uncleared garbage and overflowing drains.\n\nThe verdict points to other shifts, too. Surely, Kejriwal\u2019s party had initiated reforms in schools and healthcare but the voters were asking for more than just the daily \u201ctu tu main main\u201d between the L-G and the state. Many appear to have voted for BJP hoping that with the resources it is endowed with, and with power at its command at the Centre, it would be better placed to do this than Kejriwal\u2019s AAP.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s narrative after its Lok Sabha losses helped it to course-correct in Haryana and Maharashtra. In Delhi, the middle class seems to have bought the argument that \u201cfreebies\u201d were doled to the poor at their expense. Many were convinced that the \u201cdouble engine\u201d sarkar would be beneficial to them. Besides the organisational heft of the BJP, what also helped the party was the way the RSS came out in its support \u2014 as it had done in Haryana and Maharashtra.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThose associated with the Sangh talked about 50,000 \u201cdrawing room\u201d meetings that RSS functionaries had with small groups of people to mobilise their support. The normal sympathy that might have come Kejriwal\u2019s way for the way his government was hobbled, with agencies putting him and his colleagues in jail for months before the elections, was missing.\n\nThe voters have become that much more transactional and pragmatic, aspirational and demanding. Even as caste and community have not disappeared as voting imperatives in different parts of India, Delhi holds out lessons which other states can ill afford to ignore.\n\nThe Delhi outcome is bad news for the entire Opposition, for it gives new heart and new impetus to the BJP. It has shown up the fault lines in the INDIA bloc, of which the AAP and the Congress are a part. \u201cAur lado\u201d, J&K CM Omar Abdullah taunted both the parties.\n\nMost regional parties in INDIA chose to support Kejriwal \u2014 and not the Congress \u2014 in Delhi, as the two parties fought separately. It is possible that both the AAP and the Congress, which has not moved beyond the princely figure of \u201c0\u201d seats it had notched up in the last two elections, might have fared better had they fought together. Clearly, Opposition parties have to refashion the INDIA alliance if they want to remain relevant. The Congress, whose vote share rose about 2 percentage points to 6.34%, lost deposits in at least 60 seats but polled more votes than the AAP\u2019s margin of defeat in 13 constituencies.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe AAP\u2019s defeat poses existential challenges for a political startup which has so far had a dream run. What will be its impact on the AAP government in Punjab? Or on the cases against Kejriwal and his colleagues in the liquor scam? Will an attempt now be made to delist the AAP as a politicalentity as the ED has suggested?\n\nAAP leaders will now be called to draw on all the reserves at their command to remain afloat, work the street to win back the confidence of the aam aadmi \u2013 and fight another day.\n\n(Neerja Chowdhury, Contributing Editor, The Indian Express, has covered the last 11 Lok Sabha elections.

The AAP tally went from the 63 seats it won in the 2020 election to 22 seats.\n\n\u201cWhat once started as a people\u2019s movement had now fizzled into a mere political party,\u201d said Neelanjan Sircar, a senior fellow at the Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research (CPR), referring to the AAP. \u201cKejriwal is perhaps just a politician now and once that shine wears off, the core voters\u2019 affiliation is weakened.\u201d\n\nDelhi, where more than 33 million people live and the national capital city, New Delhi, is located, is the centre of political power in India \u2013 and one that for more than a quarter of a century has remained out of the grip of the BJP despite its meteoric political rise under Modi since 2014.\n\n\u201cDelhi is a mini India, it has a substantial population from various regions of the country \u2013 and the BJP has shown that if they can win Delhi, they can win anything,\u201d Rasheed Kidwai, a political analyst, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThis turnaround is significant because this victory is a story of BJP\u2019s micromanagement in constituencies. And tells us that they are unmatched.\u201d\n\nBJP\u2019s ride to the capital\n\nModi\u2019s BJP suffered a humbling moment in June last year when the Hindu nationalist party lost its parliamentary majority in the national election and was left to govern with the support of regional allies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven months later, the BJP has comfortably won three major state elections \u2013 Maharashtra, Haryana and Delhi \u2013 where it was expected to face a resurging opposition, analysts told Al Jazeera, further cementing its expanding control over Indian polity.\n\n\u201cSince the [national] election, our party has been reaching out to our grassroots workers, who have worked hard, to ensure that the message of prosperity reaches every voter,\u201d Zafar Islam, BJP\u2019s national spokesperson, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThis is a defeat of the AAP\u2019s arrogance and bad governance.\u201d\n\nWhile the AAP had come to be known for its welfare programmes, the BJP doubled down on similar promises in its campaign which also took on a Hindu nationalist undertone in Delhi. \u201cElections in India have become highly transactional and the voter wants to know what will they get for their vote,\u201d said Kidwai.\n\nDelhi\u2019s electorate is also among the most unequal, with regard to caste and class differences, said Sircar. \u201cUnless you\u2019re able to get at least some bits and pieces of all the population, it\u2019s going to be hard to win the election,\u201d he said. A section of so-called \u201cupper-caste\u201d voters, which form nearly 40 percent of Delhi\u2019s population, he added, had flocked across to the BJP, attracted by promises of subsidies and development as well as a desire for change following more than a decade of AAP rule.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, in which nearly 9.5 million people voted on Wednesday, the BJP did not confirm its pick for chief minister for Delhi, which Kidwai said, worked in the party\u2019s favour. \u201cThere was no disillusionment [about any one candidate] among the different castes or voters from other regions and the suspense kept the stage even for them and rolled to their advantage.\u201d\n\nThe Congress party, India\u2019s oldest party, which leads the national opposition, INDIA alliance, has remained on the periphery in the assembly for some time and, for the third election in a row, failed to win a single seat in the Delhi assembly election.\n\nClearly surprised by the results, Nivedita Menon, a professor of politics at Delhi\u2019s prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said: \u201cIt feels like BJP will never lose an election again. They have the system sewn up tight.\u201d\n\n\u2018Message for Kejriwal\u2019\n\nBefore the national election last year, Kejriwal was arrested by India\u2019s financial crime agency on corruption charges. His deputy, Sisodia, has spent 17 months in Tihar jail, Delhi, on charges of money laundering. His trial is continuing. And their two terms, secured by landslide victories, were marred by the continuous tussle with the centre-appointed lieutenant governor to wrestle more control over Delhi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis time, it was Kejriwal\u2019s turn for a humbling moment when, on Saturday morning, his party lost the Delhi assembly to the BJP. The AAP had touted the election as a referendum on its governance, and its leaders\u2019 innocence in the cases they claim are a political vendetta by the BJP.\n\n\u201cThere was now this imagination that Kejriwal and AAP also do politics as usual \u2013 and they are not cleaner than other parties,\u201d said Sircar, adding that middle-class voters appeared \u201cdisillusioned with Kejriwal\u2019s tactics and constant confrontation with the central government\u201d.\n\nThe BJP has won all seven of Delhi\u2019s seats in the last three parliamentary elections but had until now failed to win the voters in the assembly election, which is held every five years.\n\n\u201cThere was strong anti-incumbency [against the AAP] after a decade and that hurt its image among middle-class voters, which resulted in the swing,\u201d Sircar added. \u201cAnd the BJP had an edge in the perception battle [against] Kejriwal \u2013 that he just cries foul, or he is a \u2018hoax\u2019, and does not perform in governance.\u201d\n\nKejriwal lost his assembly seat, the New Delhi constituency, to BJP\u2019s Parvesh Verma \u2013 who has previously called for a \u201csocial boycott\u201d of Muslims \u2013 by more than 3,100 votes in the New Delhi constituency. Sisodia also lost the Jangpura constituency in southeast Delhi to the BJP.\n\n\u201cThat is a clear message that things were not good for Kejriwal because any political party that has all heavyweights trailing means there is no way they could come to power,\u201d said Kidwai, the analyst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnchartered territory\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, silence fell over the AAP\u2019s party headquarters. Experts say the party now needs to focus on picking up the pieces. \u201cIt will put them in a difficult spot because in Delhi they have been in power since their inception. The party has not faced a time out of power in Delhi,\u201d said Rahul Verma, a political commentator.\n\n\u201cTheir national leaders losing is an embarrassment and will choke the expansionist impulse, which AAP had a couple of years ago,\u201d said Verma, referring to the other Indian state elections where the AAP has been competing, such as Gujrat, and Jammu and Kashmir. Currently, Kejriwal\u2019s party also governs the neighbouring state of Punjab.\n\nWith Kejriwal out of the upcoming assembly, the tables have turned in Delhi politics, experts said. This is unchartered territory.\n\nFor more than 10 years, the BJP has maintained complete control over the country\u2019s parliament, located in New Delhi, but always remained at a distance from state powers. \u201cThe BJP now has the same kind of centralisation that Modi has been peddling, the so-called \u2018double engine\u2019 campaign,\u201d said Sircar.\n\nBut the saffron party needs to be cautious, he warned, as Delhi has changed since the BJP last won the assembly election in 1993. Sircar said: \u201cThe BJP has not governed Delhi that looks like this or feels like this \u2013 a modern cosmopolitan imagination.\u201d",

It is tipped to win at least one more seat.\n\nBJP's Parvesh Sahib Singh, who is widely expected to be the capital's next chief minister, defeated Kejriwal.\n\n\"Delhi has chosen development,\" Singh said in his victory statement.\n\nSingh, 47, comes from a family of politicians, and his father served as Delhi's chief minister in the early 1990s.\n\nA former national lawmaker, Singh courted controversy in 2022 when he appeared to call for a \"total boycott\" of Muslims, although he did not explicitly refer to the community by name.\n\n\"Our victory is a sign of the people's faith in Prime Minister Modi's vision of progress,\" interior minister and BJP stalwart Amit Shah said in a statement.\n\n\"The Delhi mandate shows that people can't be misled with lies every time.\"\n\nKejriwal, who rode to power as an anti-corruption crusader a decade ago, spent several months behind bars last year over accusations that his party took kickbacks in exchange for liquor licenses, along with several fellow party leaders.\n\nHe has denied wrongdoing and characterized the charges as a political witch hunt by Modi's government.\n\nHe was one of the key pillars of an opposition bloc formed ahead of India's general elections last year, when the BJP suffered significant losses despite holding on to power.\n\nKejriwal's defeat in his Delhi stronghold puts the BJP \"back in a very strong position,\" said Rahul Verma of the Centre for Policy Research think tank in New Delhi.\n\n\"Now it seems what happened in the general elections was a temporary lapse,\" Verma said. \"And it has put AAP in a difficult position going ahead.\"\n\nDespite weeks of intense campaigning, little was said about Delhi's crippling air pollution crisis, which smothers the city for months in hazardous fumes.\n\nNew Delhi is regularly ranked the worst capital in the world for choking smog, which often surges as much as 60 times the World Health Organization's recommended daily maximum.\n\nYears of piecemeal government initiatives have failed to measurably address the problem, with the smog blamed for thousands of premature deaths annually and particularly affecting the health of children and the elderly.",

      "content": "In the Malayalam movie Kayamkulam Kochunni, the protagonist, Kochunni, saw his father being humiliated and abused by upper-caste men for stealing rice. He later becomes a well-known thief who is celebrated for stealing rice from the rich and serving it to the poor. Kochunni was an actual person who lived during the early 19th century when India was under British rule, and even though his legacy is disputed because of his wrongdoings, he became what he was because of the struggles he faced due to caste discrimination and social injustice. Just like Kochunni\u2019s father, a Dalit man was attacked for the suspicion that he stole rice in Chhattisgarh in December 2024. He was tied up to a tree and lashed out by three people, resulting in him losing consciousness and dying. India hasn't been able to move away from its casteist roots; dominant castes have found ways to discriminate against backward communities in social settings, especially using food.\n\nCultural laws and food regulations have kept changing based on circumstances in India. Meat eating, previously a widespread practice, was suddenly recognised as impure based on the caste hierarchy. Vegetarianism is linked with purity and has become a determinant factor in access to public resources like water, education, temples, etc. Simultaneously, food became a significant factor in practising untouchability across the country. The upper caste was privileged and could purchase the best vegetables and dairy goods, so they weren't troubled by this change in contrast to lower caste people, who had no option but to sustain their lives with meat consumption, resulting in them being considered untouchables.\n\nBrahmins, Kshatriya, and Vysya communities are primarily associated with vegetarianism across the country, whereas Shudras and Dalits consume nonvegetarian food, which is considered an impure practice. As a result of caste-based purity and impurity, Brahmin man was allowed to eat food only if prepared by a Brahmin. In several states of India, Sakshibhojanam' (seeing Bramhin eat) and 'Panthibhojanam' (community eating) was only practised among dominant castes, excluding Dalits. These complex customs were a way to show their power, superiority, and dominance and to assert themselves as the pure caste.\n\nSegregation at restaurants and cafes based on caste and religion is one of the many subtle kinds of discrimination that went unrecognised in modern India. Many restaurants were named after superior castes, where Dalits and Muslims were either refused admission, made to eat off-site, or instructed to use different utensils and wash them by themselves.",

      "content": "Since Delhi\u2019s first legislative Assembly was constituted in 1952, the national capital has had only eight Assemblies and Chief Ministers. This is because for 37 years, from 1956 to 1993, Delhi\u2019s Assembly was abolished and it was made a Union Territory. The national capital nonetheless boasts a colourful political history, with the Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party, and Aam Aadmi Party dominating at different points of time.\n\nWho gets to govern Delhi? This question has loomed large over Delhi\u2019s politics since the city became the capital of British India in 1911.\n\nBy 1919, the British had broken Delhi away from the erstwhile Punjab province. The capital was effectively brought under direct rule of the Viceroy, through a Chief Commissioner. After Independence, this system continued, except the Chief Commissioner was now under the President of India.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhen the Constitution was adopted on Jaunuary 26, 1950, Delhi was classified as a centrally administered Part-C state. It was one of seven such states \u2014 the others being Bhopal, Ajmer, Coorg, Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh, and Vindhya Pradesh \u2014 to have a legislative Assembly, although the powers of this Assembly were limited.\n\nBrahm Prakash (right) and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. (Express Archive) Brahm Prakash (right) and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. (Express Archive)\n\nIn the 1951-52 elections, Delhi had 42 Assembly constituencies, and 48 seats in the Assembly in total (six constituencies sent two members to the House). Congress secured 39 seats, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (predecessor of the BJP) won five, while the Socialist Party won two.\n\nPrime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru chose Brahm Prakash, a 34-year-old Yadav farmer and president of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, as Delhi\u2019s first Chief Minister, bypassing the claims made by Congress stalwart and Chandni Chowk MLA Dr Yudhvir Singh. Prakash took oath as CM on March 17, 1952.\n\nDelhi Assembly is abolished\n\nThe young CM, however, soon clashed with the Chief Commissioner \u2014 much like Delhi CMs in recent years have been clashing with Lieutenant Governors (LG) appointed by the Centre. The clash ended with Prakash\u2019s eventual resignation on February 12, 1955.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIn an interview to the Prime Ministers\u2019 Museum and Library (then the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library), Prakash said \u201c[After] A D Pandit became Chief Commissioner, he wanted to interfere in every matter\u2026 he did not like any elected representative\u2026\u201d.\n\nAlso Read | Statehood for Delhi: Tracing the history and legal journey since 1911\n\nPrakash also spoke about how his 1955 proposal for carving out a Maha Dilli \u2014 a state comprising Delhi, parts of Western UP, Punjab, and Rajasthan \u2014 was not received well by the Centre. This would have seen Delhi becoming a full state.\n\n\u201cThis was opposed by the Congress\u2019 UP leadership, particularly [then Union Home Minister] Govind Ballabh Pant who said that the land of Ram and Krishna cannot be divided\u2026 Perhaps Panditji [Nehru] also did not like it\u2026 Politically, I had to pay a huge price for that,\u201d Prakash said.\n\nAfter Prakash\u2019s resignation, Daryaganj MLA Gurumukh Nihal Singh was sworn in as Chief Minister on February 13. But his tenure would not last long.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nGurmukh Nihal Singh was the first Governor of Rajasthan and second Chief Minister of Delhi from 1955 to 1956 and was a Congress leader. (Express Archive) Gurmukh Nihal Singh was the first Governor of Rajasthan and second Chief Minister of Delhi from 1955 to 1956 and was a Congress leader. (Express Archive)\n\nThe States Reorganisation Commission headed by Justice Fazl Ali submitted its report just a few months after Nihal Singh entered office. It notably said that \u201cthe future of Delhi has to be determined primarily by the important consideration that it is the seat of the Union Government\u201d, and that it was \u201cnot surprising\u201d that the \u201cpeculiar diarchical structure\u201d in place at the time had \u201cnot worked smoothly\u201d. The Commission thus recommended that \u201ca separate state government\u201d for Delhi was no longer required.\n\nOn November 1, 1956, Nihal Singh resigned, the Delhi Assembly was abolished, and Delhi became a Union Territory.\n\n37 years without an Assembly\n\nThe Fazl Ali Commission had also recommended handing over local governance to the people of Delhi. The Delhi Municipal Corporation Act was thus passed in 1957, and constituted a municipal corporation for the whole of Delhi. (The New Delhi Municipal Council was operational in some shape or form from as early as 1913, but its jurisdiction was only restricted to what is today called Lutyens\u2019 Delhi).\n\nThis did not, however, put an end to demands for statehood and an elected Assembly. The Delhi Administration Act of 1966 was meant to placate these demands. It provided for a Metropolitan Council, a democratic body comprising 56 elected members, and 5 members nominated by the President. However, this body only had recommendatory powers. The ultimate decision-making authority in Delhi still vested with the Centre, through an LG or Administrator appointed by the President.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nLK Advani (right) releasing the book Kamal Shaashvat Sanskriti written by V K Malhotra (left).

Vijay Kumar Malhotra became the Chief Executive Councillor (CEC) while L K Advani became the Council\u2019s Chairman after the Jana Sangh won 33 seats. In the 1972 polls, Congress won 44 seats, and Radha Raman became CEC. Mir Mushtaq Ahmed became the Chairman.\n\nIn 1977, the Janata Party won 46 seats. Kidar Nath Sahni became CEC and Kalka Dass the Chairman. In 1983, Congress returned to power with 34 seats. Jag Parvesh Chandra became CEC and Purushottam Goyal became the chairman of the Council.\n\nDelhi gets an Assembly again\n\nWhile it remained a UT, almost every politician in the capital fought for statehood, or at the very least a proper legislative Assembly with more than just recommendatory powers. Finally, in 1991, the P V Narasimha Rao government restored some powers to the Delhi government.\n\nDelhi was to have an Assembly with 70 seats. But its government was to have no control over land (which remained with the DDA, a statutory body under the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs), and law and order (Delhi Police stayed under the Union Home Ministry). This system remains in place today.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAssembly elections held in November 1993 were dominated by the BJP, with leaders such as Madan Lal Khurana, O P Kohli, and V K Malhotra leading the charge. The party won 49 seats, even as the Congress\u2019 tally dropped to 14, in no small part due to the party\u2019s role in the anti-Sikh riots that rocked the national capital in 1984.

Due to mounting pressure, he was forced to resign less than a year later, paving the way for Jat leader Sahib Singh Verma to become the fourth Delhi CM on February 27.\n\nSahib Singh Verma was an Indian politician and the former senior vice-president of the Sahib Singh Verma was an Indian politician and the former senior vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Party . (Express Archive/Ravi Batra)\n\nBut the BJP continued to slide in the national capital, amidst rampant infighting and a leadership crisis. Just a few months ahead of the 1998 Assembly polls, Sushma Swaraj, who at the time was the MP from South Delhi, was sworn in as CM on October 13.\n\nSushma Swaraj was a senior member of the Bhartiya Janta Party and former External Affairs Minister in the first Modi\u2019s government.

Dikshit also championed Delhi buses switching to CNG, privatised power distribution companies, and trifurcated the Municipal Corporation of Delhi.\n\nMeanwhile, the BJP struggled to put its act together. Ahead of the 2003 polls, although many in the party wanted younger leaders like Arun Jaitley and Dr Harsh Vardhan to take the lead, the old guard decided to once again project Khurana as the party\u2019s CM face. The BJP won only 20 seats. Dikshit returned to power with 47.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThen in 2008, the BJP looked past Harsh Vardhan once again, this time in favour of V K Malhotra, another older face. Despite facing heavy anti-incumbency, Dikshit retained power, winning 43 out of 70 seats.\n\nAfter the results were announced, Advani and other BJP leaders complained to the Election Commission of India, alleging manipulation of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) by the Congress.\n\nRise of AAP, Kejriwal\n\nBy the time the 2013 polls came along, the Congress was in dire straits both nationally and in Delhi. Manmohan Singh\u2019s UPA government at the Centre had been rocked by a spate of corruption allegations which gave birth to a powerful anti-graft movement in Delhi.\n\nThe ostensibly apolitical India Against Corruption movement, which peaked in 2010-11, has had a lasting impact on India\u2019s politics. Not only did it pave the way for Congress to be removed from power at the Centre in 2014, it also introduced a new player in the politics of Delhi.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nArvind Kejriwal in 2014. (Express Photo by Ravi Kanojia).\n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party was formed in November 2012 by the likes of Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Prashant Bhushan, and Yogendra Yadav (the last two were expelled in 2015), all of whom rose to national prominence on the coattails of India Against Corruption. AAP came with the promise of cleaning up politics, and ushering in true accountability.\n\nDespite being less than a year old, AAP in the 2013 polls managed to win 28 seats, with Kejriwal defeating Dikshit in the New Delhi constituency. Congress won only eight seats, and the BJP under Harsh Vardhan 31.\n\nWith the Assembly hung, Kejriwal went back on his promise to \u201cnever take support from the Congress\u201d, and became CM. But he resigned after only 49 days, citing his failure to mobilise support for anti-corruption legislation.\n\nDelhi would be under the President\u2019s rule for about a year, until polls were held again in February 2015. This time, the BJP projected former IPS officer Kiran Bedi, another prominent face during the IAC movement, as its CM candidate \u2014 with disastrous consequences.\n\nKejriwal and AAP won a whopping 67 of 70 seats. BJP was left with only three seats, while the Congress failed to open its account. AAP comfortably returned to power in 2020, winning 62 seats.",

      "title": "Delhi Election 2025: Key Lessons for BJP, Congress, AAP and INDIA Alliance",
      "content": "Published : Feb 09, 2025 19:24 IST - 7 MINS READ\n\nThe BJP\u2019s comeback in Delhi after nearly three decades of exile from power (since 1998) is a reaffirmation of the saffron party\u2019s election-winning prowess and puts paid to the theory that the party only wins States where the Congress is the main challenger.\n\nAfter it vanquished the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), the regional tiger in Odisha, and defeated regional parties who powered the INDIA combine in Maharashtra, the BJP has now dealt a body blow to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi, which indicates its growing might, and that should be worrying for the Congress.\n\nAlso Read | Will BJP break its losing streak in Delhi?\n\nHowever, the grand old party is busy rejoicing over the end of the AAP story that began in 2013, when Arvind Kejriwal defeated former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and earned the sobriquet of \u201cgiant slayer\u201d. The fact that Kejriwal is the giant who has been slayed this time round might be of some comfort to Sandeep Dikshit, Sheila Dikshit\u2019s son, who challenged Kejriwal in the New Delhi constituency and polled 4,500-plus votes. The fact remains, however, that despite talking about the achievements of Sheila Dikshit\u2019s 15-year tenure, the Congress could not win even a single seat, which offers little hope for the party\u2019s revival in Delhi.\n\nChallenge before Congress\n\nKejriwal\u2019s defeat at the hands of Parvesh Verma, son of former BJP Delhi Chief Minister Sahib Singh Verma, considered a relatively lightweight candidate, and the Congress being relegated to a distant third point to the enormous challenge that lies before the Congress in its road to revival. Compounding the confusion is the \u201cekla chalo\u201d (go it alone) pitch of a section of Congress leaders, who have been exhorting the party\u2019s top leadership to stop piggybacking on regional parties in States where the regional satraps owe their rise to the decline of the Congress.\n\nIn the run-up to the Delhi election, Ajay Maken, one of the most prominent Congress leaders from Delhi who is also the party\u2019s treasurer, repeatedly spoke about the Congress having made a mistake by aligning with the AAP twice, and that perhaps this mistake was the reason why the Congress was not a beneficiary of the anti-incumbency against Kejriwal. The Delhi result opens up the question again about the party\u2019s future course and whether it is in a position take a totally independent route. The irony of Congress leaders celebrating the AAP\u2019s defeat despite itself winning zero seats in the last three Lok Sabha elections in Delhi as well as in the 2015, 2020, and the 2025 Assembly elections was lost on nobody.\n\nSanjay Jha, who was sacked as Congress spokesperson for \u201cbreach of discipline\u201d after his comments about the state of affairs in the party, did not hide his anguish at the results. On the social media platform X, he said: \u201cZero seats in 3 consecutive state assembly elections in #Delhi is unforgivable. This, after the late Sheila Dikshit won three solid mandates (1998, 2003, 2008) and literally transformed Delhi. She only lost because of negative perceptions about the UPA government. The Congress has let down her legacy.\u201d The overall mood in the Congress, however, was one of jubilation at the AAP\u2019s defeat.\n\nKeen to disallow the credit of victory to the BJP and slam the AAP at the same time, Congress general secretary in-charge for communications Jairam Ramesh said: \u201cThe 2025 Delhi Vidhan Sabha election results reflect nothing more than a referendum on Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party.... This vote is a rejection of Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s politics of deceit, deception, and vastly exaggerated claims of achievement.\u201d\n\nCongress\u2019 campaigns\n\nHe also cited the \u201cvigorous campaign\u201d launched by the Congress in Delhi. But perhaps the campaign came too late. The Congress has a history of running similar campaigns that other parties have finally gained from. For instance, in 2010-11, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi led a vigorous campaign against Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh. However, in the 2012 Assembly election it was Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP) who emerged victorious.\n\nA year earlier, the Congress had joined hands with Mamata Banerjee\u2019s Trinamool Congress to script the end of the 34-year-old rule of the Left Front in West Bengal. But 13 years later, the Congress ended up allying with the Left to fight the Trinamool in the Lok Sabha election. After the results, Mamata Banerjee said her party lost in four seats because of the Congress. This year, both Akhilesh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee of the INDIA bloc, rather than the Congress, lent support to Kejriwal, and he was grateful for it.\n\nBJP breaks 27-year jinx\n\nFor the BJP, breaking the Delhi jinx after 27 years is the return of a favourable old pattern witnessed in some other States, where a regional party first takes away the space occupied by the Congress and the BJP then becomes the ruling party, defeating the regional outfit either on its own or in alliance with another party, as in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, and Karnataka.\n\nIn Karnataka, the first BJP government was formed in 2007 after a brief stint of the Janata Dal (Secular) government in 2006, which was the fifth government formed by the Janata Party or its offshoots in an otherwise Congress-dominated State. The BJP then chipped away substantially at the Janata Dal\u2019s space.\n\nIn Tripura, the Trinamool took on the Congress, but by 2023 the BJP had nudged them both out. In Bihar, the space occupied by the Congress went to the Janata Dal and later got split among the Janata Dal (United), or JD(U), the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). Later, the BJP allied with the JD(U) and the LJP, which led to the formation of a National Democratic Alliance government in Bihar that has continued since October 2005 with brief disruptions.\n\nWith the defeat of the Naveen Patnaik\u2013led BJD in Odisha and the Arvind Kejriwal\u2013led AAP in Delhi, the only regional party leader in a position to take on the BJP solo remains Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, and even there the saffron party has made deep inroads\u2014having won 77 seats in the 2021 Assembly election and notching up a 38.1 per cent vote share. The BJP won 12 Lok Sabha seats in 2024 in the State, while maintaining its vote share of 38 per cent.\n\nSaffron surge\n\nAfter Odisha and Delhi, the saffron party is clearly emerging as a choice in regions where it was lagging behind. Earlier, experts often attributed the Congress\u2019 frequent defeats at the hands of the BJP to the fact that the Congress is not a cadre-based party. But by defeating a cadre-based political startup like the AAP, the BJP has turned that argument too in its favour. Barring Jharkhand, the BJP has won all the Assembly elections held after its subdued victory in the 2024 Lok Sabha election: Haryana, Maharashtra, and Delhi. Rasheed Kidwai, political analyst and author, told Frontline: \u201cThe Delhi verdict shows that the BJP seems to have cracked the code of \u2018how to win an election\u2019. At another level, it has rung the death knell for INDIA combine partners.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Congress is back in Delhi as a force to reckon with: Devender Yadav\n\nHowever, winning Delhi is like riding a tiger. For the BJP, meeting expectations will be a huge challenge, as the election was fought on big promises. Also, with the BJP being in control both at the Centre and in the State, there is no scapegoat to be blamed this time.\n\nFor the Congress, the alacrity with which the top party leadership targeted Kejriwal and the AAP shows that the INDIA combine of 2024 is no firm or close-knit alliance; its members will not shy away from fighting each other to protect their turfs, at least in Assembly elections. The Congress fought the last Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh in 2022 on its own and won just one seat, but when it contested the Lok Sabha election in 2024 in alliance with the SP it won six. In Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, and Jharkhand, the Congress is heavily dependent on allies such as the SP, the RJD, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha.\n\nIt is clear that when the Congress decides to go it alone, it is punching above its weight and also countering the efforts of the regional parties. These parties could well decide to close ranks against the grand old party and its plans to reclaim lost glory.",

Divided into seven chapters, the author covers aspects that have shaped the politics of Delhi in the last decade. From healthcare and education to economics and environment, the book looks at some of the imperative issues in the capital that need immediate attention.\n\nOn the Congress having dominated national politics for decades with a significant impact on the national capital, Bhasin writes, \u201cI remember how the Congress government was regularly criticised for its misgovernance and corruption across India, and Delhi was no exception.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe book explores the role of migrants settled in colonies in eastern and northeastern Delhi in the electoral outcomes in the national capital, which is talked about in great detail.\n\nThe simplified style of writing makes it easy for the reader to understand the layered political complexities of the national capital. As the director of Centre for Policy and Planning, Bhasin uses data extensively to make the reader understand the reason behind the growing opposition AAP has faced in the last one year.\n\nIt mentions the \u2018deteriorating healthcare services and facilities in the national capital posing a grave challenge that demands urgent and decisive action\u2019. With the pandemic having exposed critical vulnerabilities in healthcare systems globally, the author believes that it should have been a wake-up call for everybody including the people of Delhi.\n\nA growing concern about the rising pollution in Delhi finds a mention in the book, where the author calls it not just an environmental concern but a public health emergency. He says, \u201cThe soaring incidence of pollution-related diseases in Delhi is not only endangering lives but also diminishing the quality of life in the nation\u2019s capital.\u201d\n\nOverall, the book is a call for urgent reform and a more responsible approach to governance.",

      "content": "Introduction\n\nOn June 9, 2024, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his handpicked Council of Ministers were sworn into office to lead India\u2019s newly elected government following the country\u2019s eighteenth general election. While the cast of characters occupying the topmost ranks of the government closely resembled the previous Modi administration, which held office between May 2019 and May 2024, a not-so-subtle shift took place beneath the surface.\n\nAs nationwide voting kicked off over forty-four days and in seven phases, Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was widely expected to win a third consecutive single-party majority in India\u2019s lower house of Parliament (the Lok Sabha). This expectation was based on two distinct data points. First, preelection surveys fielded in early 2024 were unanimous in predicting a BJP landslide. For instance, the India Today Mood of the Nation poll, released in January 2024, projected that the BJP would win 304 of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners chipping in another 31 seats. Top BJP officials themselves widely held the notion of an election landslide: the party went to the polls touting the slogan \u201cAbki Baar 400 Paar\u201d (\u201cthis time, more than 400 seats\u201d), projecting confidence that the BJP and its allies would clinch a supermajority in the parliamentary election.\n\nSecond, exit polls suggested that while such lofty ambitions might be out of reach, the BJP would face little trouble securing a clear majority. In reality, however, the final vote count was quite different. Ultimately, the BJP won just 240 seats out of the 543 up for grabs, short of the 272 seats needed for a parliamentary majority and 63 seats fewer than it won in 2019. For the first time since Modi catapulted to power in 2014, the BJP is reliant on its NDA coalition partners to stake its claim to the government. In the end, the NDA\u2019s 293 seat total provides the BJP with more than enough support to govern comfortably. The opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), in turn, far exceeded expectations, capturing 234 seats. The coalition, comprising three dozen parties, was significantly boosted by a reversal of fortune for the Indian National Congress (Congress Party); the once-dominant national party won 99 seats, a near doubling of its 2019 tally and the first sign in a decade of its national renewal.\n\nOn paper, at least, these results heralded a return to coalition politics\u2014marking a sharp break with the previous decade of unquestioned BJP single-party dominance. Between 1989 and 2014, India experienced a \u201ccoalition era\u201d of national politics in which no single party was powerful enough to form the government on its own. For a quarter-century, governments were formed through a combination of pre- and post-election alliance arrangements, diffusing power toward smaller regional parties whose support was essential for national parties to govern. The centrality of regional parties to government formation also enhanced the status of India\u2019s state governments in the relative power balance between New Delhi and state capitals.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s historic election triumph in 2014 put a decisive end to the coalition period by securing the first parliamentary single-party majority in three decades, winning 282 seats. No party had achieved such a milestone since 1984, when the Congress Party won a landslide victory in the aftermath of Indira Gandhi\u2019s assassination. The BJP\u2019s subsequent general election victory in 2019 only bolstered its numbers, cementing it as the new dominant party. As one of the authors has previously argued, the return of a dominant party in 2014 and the dramatic expansion of the BJP\u2019s electoral footprint marked the beginning of a new electoral system in India known as the \u201cfourth party system.\u201d\n\nThe resurgence of coalition politics in New Delhi and the presence of a much stronger political opposition together raise the question of whether the 2024 verdict reflects a repudiation of the fourth party system and a reversion to a more decentralized, fragmented era. Drawing on newly available data from the 2024 general election, this paper argues that, while the 2024 verdict represents a curtailing of the BJP\u2019s dominance, many attributes of the fourth party system remain intact. Although the BJP fell short of a parliamentary majority, it remains a system-defining party. By and large, parties contest elections in India in favor of, or in opposition to, the Modi-led BJP. Furthermore, the BJP remains the single largest party in terms of its presence in the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha (India\u2019s upper house), and the country\u2019s various state assemblies. While the recent general election results produced a greater degree of political fragmentation, stimulated more intense political competition, and lacked a coherent, all-India narrative, prevailing political conditions have more in common with a dominant party system than truly decentralized coalition politics. Nevertheless, the results of the 2024 general election demonstrate a weakening\u2014if not quite a reversal\u2014of several pillars underlying the fourth party system.\n\nThe following sections lay out the core principles of the fourth party system and how they differ from past systems. Then, they use data from the 2024 election to evaluate whether there are signs of reversal, either indicating a transition to a new system or a reversion to an older one. This paper examines principles underlying the fourth party system including the presence of a dominant party, rising political centralization, declining political competition, a nationalization of electoral politics, heightened voter mobilization in general elections, and changes in caste mobilization and representation. Finally, it enumerates potential factors that could disrupt the existing system.\n\nEvolution of India\u2019s Party Systems\n\nBuilding on a framework developed and popularized by political scientist Yogendra Yadav, India has arguably witnessed four \u201cparty systems\u201d since its independence from the British Raj in 1947.\n\nThe first party system, dominated by the Congress Party, was in place from the time of independence until the elections of 1967, the year when the Congress Party\u2019s grip on power in India\u2019s states began to sharply wane. In the second party system, stretching from 1967 to 1989, the Congress Party largely retained its controlling position at the center even as its popularity in national terms gradually declined. The only time its hold on power in New Delhi slipped was when it was unceremoniously voted out of office in 1977\u2014for a brief two-year period\u2014in the aftermath of Indira Gandhi\u2019s twenty-one-month period of emergency rule. India\u2019s third party system, in place from 1989 to 2014, was synonymous with an era of coalition politics and the absence of a core political party around which the party system revolved. The 2014 election ushered in a new, fourth party system and a return to a dominant party era, with the BJP occupying the central position previously held by the Congress Party.\n\nThe distinctiveness of the fourth party system is readily apparent when contrasted with the core principles of the third party system. During the coalition era, no single party was strong enough to serve as the central organizing pillar of Indian politics, and elections were marked by increasing party fragmentation, intensifying political competition, and a federalization of national politics. The third party system was also characterized by a new political sociology in which lower castes gained political representation, largely at the expense of historically dominant upper and intermediate castes.\n\nEach of these principles was challenged by the resurgence of the BJP as a dominant national force in the post-2014 era. In this period, the BJP became the undisputed central pillar around which politics was organized. While it is certainly true that the BJP governed with coalition allies, it was not dependent on them for government survival. Further, the trends of growing fragmentation, rising competition, and federalization all exhibited sharp signs of reversal. While lower castes and previously disadvantaged groups continued to exert new influence in politics, the axis of competition shifted from broad umbrella caste categories to jati (individual caste)-specific combinations. Notably, the BJP painstakingly built electoral coalitions in key states by appealing to nondominant jatis that had not necessarily benefited from government affirmative action programs. These nondominant groups argued that the bulk of the gains emanating from government schemes and benefits had flowed to a small number of dominant jatis that served as the core votaries of key regional opponents to the BJP.\n\nThe following subsections review the principles underpinning this third party system, describe how those principles are at odds with the prevailing trends in the fourth party system, and then assess whether the 2024 general election represents a departure from those dynamics.\n\nPresence of a Dominant Party\n\nThe third party system was characterized by the absence of a single party serving as the defining pole of India\u2019s political landscape. The Congress Party had played that role in the decades prior to 1989, helming every government between 1952 and 1989\u2014with the sole exception of the Janata Party government, which briefly held office between 1977 to 1979. But its declining national popularity, the rise of the BJP, and the growth in regional competitors meant it could no longer effectively play that part.\n\nIn 1998, the BJP under former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, with the support of its NDA allies, tasted national power for the first time. The BJP\u2019s inaugural governing foray lasted only thirteen months, until a key ally pulled its support and fresh elections were called. Following the 1999 elections, the BJP formed another coalition government, once more under Vajpayee\u2019s leadership, that remained in power until 2004. That year, in a surprise electoral verdict, the Congress Party emerged as the single largest party in Parliament and formed a wide-ranging coalition government with its United Progressive Alliance (UPA) partners. It repeated this feat in 2009, ruling for a decade under prime minister Manmohan Singh.\n\nIn the next election in 2014, the BJP reached new heights: it won a majority of 282 seats in the Lok Sabha, marking the beginning of a new party system in which it, not the Congress Party, became the system-defining party. The 2014 election was historic on several counts: It was the first time a party won a parliamentary majority in three decades, and it was the first time ever a party other than the Congress Party could claim this distinction. In the 2019 election, the BJP defied challenges of anti-incumbency and grew its tally to 303 seats, expanding its political footprint. Against this backdrop, there is no question that the 2024 general election represents a stunning setback for the party. Although the BJP contested 441 seats, its highest number in decades, its candidates emerged victorious in just 240.\n\nOn the surface, this statistic alone suggests major cracks in the edifice of the fourth party system. But a closer look at the data suggests that, despite experiencing a setback, the BJP retains its dominant position at the helm of the fourth party system.\n\nDisaggregating the BJP Vote\n\nFor starters, the BJP\u2019s vote share in 2024 declined by less than one percentage point in 2024 relative to 2019 (36.6 versus 37.3 percent) (figure 1). This suggests that, on an all-India level, its popularity has not changed significantly. However, its seat tally dramatically dropped (from 303 in 2019 to 240 in 2024), indicating that what has shifted is the regional distribution of that support.\n\nWhereas the BJP saw its vote share decline in its traditional bastion, the Hindi heartland (the clutch of predominantly Hindi-speaking states stretching from Rajasthan in the west to Bihar in the east), its vote share increased in eastern and southern states\u2014areas where it has traditionally been much weaker given the dominance of regional parties (see figure 2 for a visual demonstration of the BJP\u2019s changing geographic footprint).\n\nFor instance, consider the BJP\u2019s divergent performance in the five southern states and the seven largest Hindi belt states. In four of the five southern states, the BJP saw its vote share rise. In Kerala, the rise was modest (3.7 percentage points), but it was substantial in Andhra Pradesh (10.3 percentage points), Tamil Nadu (7.6 percentage points), and Telangana (15.4 percentage points). Karnataka, a state where the BJP has long had a presence, is the lone outlier where the BJP saw a decline in vote share in 2024.\n\nIn contrast to its growth in the southern states, the BJP\u2019s vote share tumbled in five of the seven largest Hindi belt states. In the other two, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, the BJP\u2019s vote grew by less than two percentage points. The BJP\u2019s underperformance in Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh specifically contributed to a significant loss of seats, ensuring a parliamentary majority would be out of reach. In 2019, the BJP won 96 seats in these three states; in 2024, its tally was reduced to 52. Had the BJP simply matched its 2019 performance five years later, it would have easily attained a parliamentary majority.\n\nAnother lens used to disaggregate the BJP vote\u2014as political analysts Yogendra Yadav, Rahul Shastri, and Shreyas Sardesai have suggested\u2014is to disaggregate states where the BJP is considered part of the \u201cestablishment\u201d and states where it is perceived as the \u201cchallenger.\u201d In establishment states, the BJP might not be the ruling party, but it is nevertheless a significant, if not dominant, player. Yadav, Shastri, and Sardesai have shown that in establishment states, the BJP lost 75 seats and saw its vote share plummet by 4.6 percentage points. In states where it is seen as a rising challenger, the party gained a dozen seats and grew its vote share by nearly six percentage points.\n\nCongress Revival?\n\nIn terms of pan-Indian parties, the BJP continues to have only a single rival: the Congress Party (see figure 3). In 2024, the Congress Party\u2019s vote share crept up to 21.2 percent, a modest upward swing from the 19.4 percent it enjoyed in 2019 (and 19.3 percent in 2014). However, the Congress Party\u2019s vote share in 2024 looks impressive only in comparison with recent elections; placed into proper historical context, its 2024 share was its third worst performance ever. Even during the heyday of the coalition period, the lowest the party\u2019s vote share dipped was 25.8 percent in 1998. Furthermore, in 2024, the vote share of the Congress Party itself was partly lifted by coalition arrangements in key states like Uttar Pradesh, where regional allies helped boost its fortunes.\n\nNevertheless, the Congress Party undoubtedly is exhibiting a new spring in its step. Although the Congress Party emerged as the single largest opposition party after the 2014 and 2019 elections, the head of its parliamentary delegation in the Lok Sabha was not awarded the official \u201cleader of opposition\u201d designation. This was due to a long-standing norm that the leading opposition party must occupy at least 10 percent of the seats in the house. Since the commencement of the 18th Lok Sabha (elected in May 2024), Congress Party leader Rahul Gandhi has occupied this role and, benefiting from the support of much stronger opposition ranks, has been a fierce critic of the present government.\n\nHowever, the fact that more than two dozen opposition parties, including the Congress Party, joined hands to form the INDIA coalition for this election is a further testament to the BJP\u2019s centrality. INDIA was expressly constructed to try and keep the BJP at bay and to deny Modi a third term. While the alliance is offering stronger pushback to the government, it still lacks common leadership, a programmatic agenda, and organizational structure. One of the tests associated with a system-defining party is the extent to which elections are fought in favor of, or in opposition to, the party with a preponderance of power. By all indications, the BJP retains that designation for now.\n\nBJP\u2019s Expanding Footprint\n\nAlthough the BJP failed to meet both internal and external electoral expectations in 2024, it did emerge as a truly pan-Indian party for the first time in its history. In 2019, the BJP fielded candidates in 436 parliamentary constituencies, compared to 421 for the Congress Party. In 2024, the BJP fielded candidates in 441 constituencies, a new record. The Congress Party, in turn, contested 328 seats\u2014the first time since independence that it fielded candidates in less than 400 seats and a clear sign that the party recognized it must cede greater space to regional partners. Of the 441 seats the BJP contested, it emerged as either the winner or runner-up in 393 instances\u2014an all-time high for the party (see figure 4). The Congress Party was a top-two finisher in 266 seats, roughly on par with its performance in 2014 (268) and 2019 (261).\n\nState-Level Dynamics\n\nAnother way of assessing the BJP\u2019s centrality is to look beyond the national stage and focus instead on the party\u2019s performance at the state level (see figure 5). In India\u2019s federal setup, states\u2014not the central government in New Delhi\u2014have jurisdiction over the most crucial aspects of day-to-day governance that affect their constituents. At the time of writing (September 2024), BJP chief ministers are in office in thirteen states (about 43 percent of all chief ministerial positions). This share fluctuated between 37 and 43 percent over the past five years. At the end of 2013, the year before Modi first came to power, the BJP held only 17 percent of all chief ministerial positions. Since 2016, it has consistently held at least twice as many posts. The current BJP share was last matched by the Congress Party in 2012, when the latter controlled thirteen chief ministerial posts.\n\nAs of the time of writing, the Congress Party only boasts chief ministerial posts in Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana, or 10 percent of all such posts. The once-dominant party has not held chief ministerships in the double-digits since 2013. Since the uptick in the BJP\u2019s state-level fortunes in the post-2014 era, the party\u2019s tally of state chief executives has been roughly on par with that of all regional parties combined.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s control of state governments has meant that its share of state legislators\u2014or members of the legislative assemblies (MLAs)\u2014has exhibited a corresponding increase (see figure 6). In 1980, just 4 percent of MLAs across India belonged to the BJP. That figure grew to 22 percent in 2004, during the final year of Vajpayee\u2019s tenure.\n\nAfter stagnating around this level for nearly a decade, the BJP\u2019s share of state legislators rose to 26 percent in 2014 and accelerated to 32 percent in 2019. At the time of writing, the BJP\u2019s share of MLAs stands at 38 percent\u2014an all-time high for the party. The last time the Congress Party enjoyed such a significant share of state lawmakers was in 1993. Parties other than the BJP and the Congress Party, in turn, have possessed a plurality of MLAs since 1990. In 2024, these regional parties\u2019 share of MLAs stands at 45 percent. This number has declined somewhat since the BJP\u2019s resurgence in 2014, when the regional party share of MLAs was 52 percent. From 1994 to 2016, regional parties almost always accounted for a majority of India\u2019s state lawmakers, with the Congress Party\u2019s plurality in 2008 the lone exception.\n\nAs these statistics demonstrate, the BJP has significantly expanded its footprint at the state level, especially in the post-2014 era. Nevertheless, despite three consecutive BJP general election victories, the party has not achieved state-level dominance by any stretch. In the sixty-six state assembly elections held since the start of 2014, the BJP has formed the first postelection government in roughly half of all states. And in the thirty-four cases where it formed the government, it did so with a single-party majority in only half of all instances.\n\nRajya Sabha Composition\n\nA final indicator of the BJP\u2019s systemic import comes from data on membership from India\u2019s upper house of parliament. The Rajya Sabha has a maximum of 245 members, 233 of which are indirectly elected by the state assemblies to serve staggered six-year terms. The other 12 members are appointed by the president based on their contributions to art, literature, science, and social service. These nominated members are allowed to affiliate with political parties within six months of their selection. Every two years, roughly one-third of Rajya Sabha terms expire and new members of Parliament (MPs) are selected. Because nearly all Rajya Sabha MPs are chosen by state legislatures, they are a proxy for a party\u2019s subnational strength.\n\nAt the time of writing, 41 percent of Rajya Sabha MPs belong to the BJP\u2014a figure that has remained roughly constant since 2020 (see figure 7). This is more than double the share of upper house MPs belonging to the BJP in 2012. As of September 2024, parties other than the BJP and the Congress Party account for 48 percent of upper house MPs, while the Congress Party held a 11 percent share\u2014its lowest proportion on record. After Rajya Sabha elections in late August 2024, the BJP has 96 MPs in the upper house, and its alliance holds a bare majority.\n\nSumming Up\n\nOverall, the latest data suggest the BJP retains a dominant political position. Nationally, its vote share has declined by a single percentage point, with losses in the Hindi heartland largely offset by gains in eastern and southern India. While the Congress Party has enjoyed a revival, its vote and seat share tally lag well behind the BJP\u2019s. In general elections, the geographic zones in which the BJP exerts influence have multiplied, while they have shrunk for the Congress Party. This fact becomes more evident when examining state politics; BJP chief ministers hold power in more than forty percent of Indian states, and nearly four in ten state legislators belong to the BJP. The BJP\u2019s growing presence in India\u2019s states, in turn, has strengthened the party\u2019s footing in India\u2019s indirectly elected upper house, where its alliance holds a bare majority of seats.\n\nPolitical Centralization\n\nA second key attribute of the third party system was rising levels of political fragmentation. This was driven by two factors. First, as the Congress Party\u2019s grip on power weakened in the 1960s and 1970s, its authority was increasingly challenged by caste and regional-based interest groups. Many of these new parties were founded by dissident Congress Party members who grew frustrated with the party\u2019s representational hypocrisy. While the party touted its status as a catchall party uniquely capable of representing a diverse m\u00e9lange of caste, regional, and linguistic interests, the reality on the ground often fell far short of these boasts. As new political entrepreneurs struck out on their own, their successes\u2014aided by their ability to play kingmakers in an era of coalitions\u2014fueled further splintering.\n\nIn 1952, 53 parties fielded parliamentary candidates in the country\u2019s inaugural general election. That number declined to 35 by 1984 before exploding to 113 in 1989, the year coalition politics came to New Delhi. Since then, the number of parties contesting Indian general elections has grown steadily; in 2024, as many as 744 distinct parties had candidates in the fray, not to mention the 3,920 candidates contesting as independent candidates without a party label.\n\nEffective Number of Parties\n\nHowever, many of these contesting parties had little chance of winning even a single parliamentary seat. Indeed, since 1962, an average of only 28.6 parties have been represented in each session of the Lok Sabha.\n\nFor this reason, political scientists do not usually look at the absolute number of parties fielding candidates or even the subset of those with a presence in the legislature. Instead, they prefer to calculate the effective number of parties (ENP), a measure that weighs parties by the number of votes (or seats) they actually earned. In practice in India, this means the effective number of parties mechanically declines during eras of dominant party rule (see figure 8).\n\nBetween 1962 and 1989, the ENP for votes remained under 5, ranging from 3.4 in 1977 to 4.7 in 1967 and 1989. During the coalition era, these numbers grew significantly, peaking at 7.6 in 2009\u2014the year the Congress Party\u2013led UPA government was reelected for a second term. This period, in retrospect, reflected the high point for party fragmentation. Beginning in 2014, but more substantially five years later, the ENP for votes declined significantly\u2014to 5.4 in 2019. In 2024, this metric hardly budged, exhibiting a value of 5.3.\n\nWith regard to ENP for seats, which weighs a party\u2019s performance by the number of seats it secured in Parliament, a similar trend emerges (see figure 9). The ENP for seats after India\u2019s 1962 general election stood at 1.9. This low figure demonstrates how dominant the Congress Party was during this early period. However, the ENP for seats surged in 1989 to 4.1 and reached its apex in 2004, after which it exhibited a steady decline. In 2014, the ENP for seats stood at 3.5, and it fell further to 3.0 in 2019.\n\nOn the metric of ENP for seats, however, there has been some sign of reversal. The ENP for seats grew to 4.2 in 2024, a level comparable to the year 1989. This is a sharp rise from the ENP value of 3.0 five years prior. The divergence between the ENP for votes and seats indicates that vote fragmentation has not changed much in 2024 relative to 2019\u2014a finding that aligns with the consistency in the BJP and Congress Party\u2019s vote share\u2014but fragmentation in terms of legislative seats has grown. This is likely an artifact of India\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system in which a small shift in votes can result in a disproportionate change in seats.\n\nOverall, vote fragmentation has not changed significantly in the past five years; the ENP for votes in 2024 is at roughly the same level as 2019. However, fragmentation in terms of seats has increased, though it is still lower than during the coalition period.\n\nPolitical Competition\n\nThe third party system witnessed rising levels of political competition, a trend that was firmly reversed in the post-2014 era, when the BJP was able to exert dominance. The 2024 election results suggest a modest shift toward more competitive elections, relative to 2019, according to several different metrics.\n\nMargin of Victory\n\nThe simplest way of measuring the degree of competition in any democratic political system is to calculate the average margin of victory\u2014or the difference in the vote share of the winner and the immediate runner-up\u2014across parliamentary constituencies in a national election (see figure 10). The average margin of victory in an Indian general election peaked at 26.1 percent in 1977\u2014the year that the Congress Party was defeated after the lifting of emergency rule. Since then, it has exhibited a considerable decline, plummeting to 9.7 percent in 2009. What this statistic means is that the average winner in a Lok Sabha constituency in 2009 defeated the runner-up by slightly less than ten percentage points.\n\nWith the BJP\u2019s rise to power in 2014, this trend sharply reversed, with the average margin touching 15.2 percent. By 2019, it had grown to 17.3 percent, signifying that constituency-level elections had become appreciably less competitive in the fourth party system. Based on this measure, 2024 marks another partial reversal as the average margin fell to 13.6 percent\u2014higher than every election since 1991 but a twenty percent decline from 2019 levels.\n\nVote Share of Winning Candidates\n\nAnother way of measuring competition is to calculate the vote share of the winning candidate (see figure 11). In India\u2019s first-past-the-post system, the candidate who earns the most votes in a constituency wins the seat, irrespective of whether they win a majority of votes. Indeed, given that there are typically more than two competitive candidates in a constituency, it is not uncommon for the winning candidate to secure far less than fifty percent of the total votes cast.\n\nAs the figure demonstrates, the average winning vote share in Lok Sabha elections steadily declined during the period of the third party system. In 1989, the average winning vote share stood at 51.2 percent, but by 2009, it had sunk to 44 percent. Things changed in 2014. That year, the average winning MP earned 47.1 percent of the constituency vote, a three percentage-point increase from 2009 levels. The average winning vote share climbed further to 52.5 percent in 2019, meaning that the average general election winner garnered a simple majority of votes in their constituency. The average winning vote share of a successful general election candidate dipped slightly to 50.3 percent in the 2024 polls, indicating a modest increase in the level of political contestation.\n\nMajority Winners\n\nAs one might expect, the share of Lok Sabha seats won with majority support exhibits a similar trend (see figure 12). Only 22 percent of MPs won their seats with more than 50 percent of the vote in 2009\u2014a precipitous decline from 40 percent in 2004. This share rose to 37 percent in 2014 and a stunning 63 percent in 2019. In line with the data on average winning vote share, this figure fell to 47 percent in 2024\u2014a decline but still the second-highest proportion since 1989.\n\nNationalization of Electoral Politics\n\nFederalization of the 2024 Verdict\n\nDuring the third party system, as scholars Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar have noted, national elections often resembled an aggregation of state-level verdicts. In earlier eras, national elections often played out as waves against, or in favor of, the ruling party at the center. Because the Congress Party was the dominant player, general elections acted as an occasional referendum on the party and its policies. In contrast, the coalition era brought states front and center as the principal venues for political contestation, a development bolstered by the growing centrality of regional parties themselves. Because regional parties in India tend to operate in a single state (or a handful of states, at most), this placed the spotlight on state issues even when voters cast the ballots in national elections. To paraphrase Yadav, during periods of political hegemony, Indians voted in state elections as if they were electing the prime minister. In the coalition era, in contrast, Indians voted in general elections as if they were selecting a state government.\n\nThe 2014 election was a watershed in this regard. A groundswell of support in favor of Modi\u2014and, by extension, the BJP\u2014was felt in diverse pockets of the country. The BJP successfully framed the contest as a choice between the dynastic Congress Party, which was beset by allegations of cronyism and policy paralysis, and the reformist, Modi-led BJP, which promised to usher in \u201cacche din\u201d (good days) for the Indian economy. The result was the first single-party parliamentary majority in thirty years. The 2019 election operated with a similar template in that the BJP, especially in the wake of terrorist attacks that occurred a few months before voting began, successfully whipped up a nationalist fervor in favor of a strong, muscular incumbent.\n\nThe dynamics of the 2024 general elections surprised many observers because they reverted to the kind of state-by-state contest India experienced before 2014. The BJP, perhaps lulled into complacency by favorable preelection polls and a popular consensus that it would handily win a third mandate, campaigned without a narrative-defining issue. Rather, it went to the polls on the back of Modi\u2019s unique popularity.\n\nA preelection survey conducted by the Lokniti Programme of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) found that 48 percent of respondents favored Modi as their next prime minister. In comparison, just 27 percent preferred Rahul Gandhi, the most visible leader of the Congress Party. The opposition, in turn, banded together to form a preelection alliance that was considerably stronger\u2014in terms of its seat-sharing arrangements\u2014and more broad-based than in 2019. The BJP\u2019s inability to craft a defining election narrative, in conjunction with significant opposition consolidation, helped create the conditions for a more federalized contest. Unlike the prior two elections, there was no discernible national wave in support of one party or leader.\n\nInteraction of State and National Elections\n\nDespite this clear reversion to the pre-2014 era, a few elements of the fourth party system remain unchanged. First, during the coalition era, national elections were regularly (and predictably) influenced by state-level political calendars. The received wisdom held that if a national election were held early on in a state government\u2019s tenure, the ruling party in that state would perform well in national elections. Conversely, if a national election were held late in a state government\u2019s term, that state ruling party would struggle in the national polls. These \u201choneymoon\u201d and \u201canti-incumbency\u201d effects were statistically robust. However, this correlation appeared to break down after 2014.\n\nFor instance, in late 2023 and just months before the 2024 elections, three Hindi heartland states\u2014Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan\u2014simultaneously held state assembly elections. The Congress Party entered those elections with sitting governments in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, while the BJP was the incumbent in Madhya Pradesh. The November 2023 results saw the BJP come to power in all three states.\n\nIn the assembly polls, the BJP won 46 percent of the vote and 60 percent of seats in Chhattisgarh, 49 percent of the vote and 71 percent of the seats in Madhya Pradesh, and 42 percent of the vote and 58 percent of the seats in Rajasthan. In the Lok Sabha elections the following year, the BJP executed a clean sweep of Madhya Pradesh\u2019s 29 parliamentary seats, but its performance in the other two states diverged. In Chhattisgarh, the BJP earned 53 percent of the vote and won 10 of 11 seats on offer. In Rajasthan, on the other hand, the party won 49 percent of the vote but just 14 of 25 parliamentary seats.\n\nVote Share Distribution\n\nAnother aspect of the weakening federal character of elections is the changing balance of power between national and regional parties. One way of gauging this is to examine the distribution of votes won by the two truly national parties (the BJP and the Congress Party) as compared to all other parties (see figure 13).\n\nBetween 1996 and 2014, there was roughly an equal distribution of votes shared by national and regional parties. Barring minor fluctuations, the BJP and Congress Party collectively earned around 50 percent of the vote, meaning that one in two votes in a general election accrued to a regional party. In 2019, and again in 2024, that roughly equal distribution was disrupted when the BJP won markedly larger vote shares. In 2019, the BJP and Congress Party collectively won 56.8 percent of the vote compared to 43.2 percent for all others. In 2024, this vote share divergence grew by an additional percentage point.\n\nThese data points merit an important caveat. In 2024, preelection coalitions were vitally important. After all, although the BJP emerged as the single largest party in Parliament, it fell short of an outright majority. Prior to the elections, the BJP expended significant political capital on resuscitating the NDA, including by recruiting two erstwhile allies who previously exited the coalition\u2014the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) led by Chandrababu Naidu and the Nitish Kumar\u2013led Janata Dal (United), or JD(U). Together, the TDP and JD(U) won 28 seats in the 2024 elections. When combined with the BJP\u2019s 240 seats, the alliance needed just 4 additional seats to secure a parliamentary majority.\n\nAs for the opposition, the Congress Party contested the fewest seats in a general election in its history, a calculated decision taken in deference to a slew of coalition partners. In a state like Uttar Pradesh, where the Congress Party has long witnessed a decline in its popular appeal, the party\u2019s seat-sharing arrangement with the Samajwadi Party (SP) undoubtedly lifted its own numbers. In 2019, the Congress Party contested the state on its own, winning 6.4 percent of the vote and capturing just 1 of the state\u2019s 80 parliamentary seats. In 2024, fighting alongside the SP, the Congress Party notched 9.5 percent of the vote and won six seats. Although observers cannot fully separate the national parties\u2019 popular appeal from that of regional parties (and vice versa), it is clear that the roughly equitable breakdown in vote share between national and regional parties has tilted in favor of the former.\n\nExamining Strike Rates\n\nOf course, not all regional parties are the same. This broad-brush category includes two distinct types of parties. The first category consists of parties whose base of support is geographically restricted to one or a handful of states (or sometimes even just one part of a single state). Most of these parties cater to specific caste or ethnic communities. The second category comprises \u201cregionalist\u201d parties, whose area of operation is also geographically limited but whose political mobilization rests on emotive appeals to their state\u2019s regional pride, culture, language, or customs.\n\nIn 2014, the BJP did exceptionally well in direct contests with the Congress Party or regional parties (see figure 14). It won 88 percent of direct, head-to-head contests with the Congress Party and 91 percent of such battles with regional parties. It fared much less well against regionalist parties, against whom it won only 28 percent of direct contests. Regionalist parties tend to populate India\u2019s eastern seaboard, starting from West Bengal in the north, continuing through Odisha, and further south to Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu. This corridor has traditionally been one of the weakest regions for the BJP, which has long struggled to shed its image of a north Indian, Hindi-speaking party.\n\nIn 2019, the BJP won a striking 92 percent of elections against the Congress Party and 83 percent of all races against regional parties, but it also vastly improved its performance against regionalist parties\u2014winning half of all such races. Much of this improvement was due to the BJP\u2019s favorable performance in the eastern states of West Bengal and Odisha, where it emerged as a major player.\n\nThe trends in 2024 deviated from the established pattern of the last decade. The BJP continued to match up relatively well with the Congress Party, though, with a 71 percent strike rate, it performed much less well than in 2014 or 2019. The BJP\u2019s performance against regional parties vastly underperformed its prior showings, with the ruling party winning in fewer than half (47 percent) of all direct contests. But the BJP held its own vis-\u00e0-vis regionalist parties, clinching 51 percent of all head-to-head fights. Taken together, these facts are in line with the overall shift in geographic support for the BJP in the recent general election.\n\nSumming Up\n\nOverall, the 2024 verdict departed from the previous decade in that it resembled an aggregation of state-level verdicts rather than a national-level wave. However, the interaction between state and national elections remains less predictable than during the coalition era, perhaps suggesting that voters are better able to distinguish between the stakes at various levels of government. Furthermore, national parties have continued a trend of growing their share of the national vote, consistent with 2014 and 2019. In 2024, however, the BJP\u2019s relative performance against both the Congress Party and regional parties worsened while it evenly split contests with regionalist parties against whom it has traditionally struggled.\n\nVoter Mobilization in National Elections\n\nOverall Voter Turnout\n\nAnother defining characteristic of the third party system pertains to patterns in voter turnout. Between 1989 and 2014, voter turnout surged at the state level but remained relatively subdued in general elections. This is arguably a natural corollary to the rise of states as the principal venues for political contestation in the eyes of the voters and the characterization of national elections as an amalgamation of state-specific verdicts.\n\nVoter turnout in the first party system averaged 60.1 percent (1952\u20131962), dipping slightly to 59.6 percent in the second party system (1967\u20131984). That level remained roughly unchanged in the third party system. In the fourth party system, however, state turnout remains elevated, and national turnout has also risen considerably (see figure 15). In 2014, India saw record-breaking turnout in a general election, at 66.4 percent. This was a significant increase from the 2004 and 2009 elections, when turnout hovered in the vicinity of 58 percent.\n\nIn 2019, turnout rose even higher, clocking in at 67.7 percent. The excitement around Modi and the popular disquiet at the end of the second term of the UPA government together help contextualize the 2014 turnout figures. Similarly, the nationalist rallying that took place after the Pulwama terrorist attacks on the eve of the 2019 general elections help explain that year\u2019s record turnout.\n\nMuch of the commentary ahead of the 2024 elections featured a narrative of sagging voter turnout. While turnout did indeed drop in the aggregate, the decline was modest: overall turnout stood at 65.8 percent in 2024, a little over half a percentage point smaller than the corresponding 2014 figure. Given two successive elections with record-breaking turnout and an election that lacked a defining issue, some mean reversion should not come as a surprise. By historical standards, general election turnout in India remains elevated. Averaging across the 2014, 2019, and 2024 elections, turnout was 66.6 percent\u2014seven and a half percentage points higher than during the third party system (1989\u20132009).\n\nClosing Gender Gap in Turnout\n\nA second dynamic that came into view during the end of the third party system and the advent of the fourth party system does not pertain to overall turnout levels but to the composition of who comes out to vote. In the first several decades after independence, female turnout consistently lagged male turnout by 8 to 12 percentage points (see figure 16). In 2004, the male-female turnout gap stood at 8.4 percent. Five years later, that gap nearly halved to 4.4 percent. In 2014, the gap shrunk further to 1.8 percent, and by 2019, it virtually disappeared (to a miniscule 0.1 percent). In 2024, the gender gap in turnout was virtually wiped out, at just 0.02 percent.\n\nThe trend of a diminishing gender gap in voter turnout is also evident in the data from state elections. In state elections held between 1961 and 1965, the male voter turnout advantage was 9.1 percentage points. This gap has dramatically narrowed over time, especially in the second half of the 2000s. From 2001\u20132005, the gender turnout gap was 4 percentage points. Astonishingly, in the next five-year period, the gap shrunk to a mere 0.3 percent. Since 2010, average female turnout has consistently outpaced male turnout in state assembly elections.\n\nCaste and Social Composition of Representation\n\nPatterns of Caste Politics\n\nAs India\u2019s party system has evolved, the way in which caste has been expressed and deployed for political mobilization has shifted. In the heyday of the third party system, political mobilization took place around the core umbrella caste/community groupings: Upper Castes, Other Backward Classes (OBC), Scheduled Castes (SC) or Dalits, and Scheduled Tribes (ST) or Adivasis. Each of these larger groupings consists of countless jatis (discrete caste groups). This framing of caste around larger, big-tent categories was driven by multiple factors: the debate over the Mandal Commission and the recommendation of affirmative action for OBCs; new Scheduled Caste assertion, especially in the form of expressly pro-Dalit political parties like the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP); and increased political outreach to tribal citizens, both through established parties like the BJP as well as through political movements championing the creation of new, Adivasi-dominated states.\n\nIn the fourth party system, these larger umbrella groupings consisting of multiple jatis became less salient. In a way, politics returned to the construction of jati-level alliances, which was the prevailing norm in the second party system. During this prior era, political parties focused on creating state-wide alliances of individual jatis in order to construct a winning coalition. In the post-2014 era, the focus on creating jati-level coalitions played out slightly differently.\n\nDominant and Nondominant Castes\n\nOne of the BJP\u2019s major successes in the Modi era has been its ability to skillfully exploit a wedge that has opened between so-called dominant jatis and subordinate groupings. Within the larger OBC and SC categories, in particular, there is significant internal heterogeneity with populous, economically powerful jatis capturing many of the gains from increased representation, affirmative action, and various government schemes. The BJP\u2019s innovation was to create additional separation between dominant and nondominant jatis by harping on these inequalities, building a base of the most socioeconomically disadvantaged groups within the OBC and Dalit categories.\n\nIn the most electorally pivotal Hindi heartland states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, Yadavs and Jatavs are widely considered the most powerful OBC and SC jatis, respectively. They also make up the core voter base of powerful regional parties opposed to the BJP. The BJP\u2019s play was to build a coalition of nondominant OBC and SC jatis that could act as a counterforce.\n\nIn 2024, this remained the BJP\u2019s strategy in northern India, but it proved far less effective. Consider the caste- and community-level data on voting patterns in Uttar Pradesh that emerged from the National Election Study carried out by Lokniti-CSDS (see figure 17). The BJP lost ground among non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits (with large numbers of these voters moving to the opposition INDIA alliance). Interestingly, the BJP made up some ground with Jatavs, though this is likely explained by the electoral collapse of the BSP, whose base has long consisted of Jatav voters. Indeed, even in 2024\u2014a historically abysmal election year for the BSP\u201444 percent of Jatav voters in Uttar Pradesh continued to back the party.\n\nA final trend worth mentioning is the further consolidation of Muslim voters behind the INDIA alliance. As one analysis of historical Lokniti-CSDS data has shown, the extent of Muslim support for the principal anti-BJP political coalition has waxed and waned over the years. For instance, in 2004, 51 percent of Muslims voted for the Congress Party\u2013led UPA while just 11 percent backed the BJP-led NDA. In 2014 and 2019, 45 percent of Muslims backed the UPA while 9 percent supported the NDA. In 2024, however, nearly two-thirds of Muslim voters (65 percent) lent their support to the INDIA alliance, against 10 percent for the NDA.\n\nData from individual states further bear this out. For instance, the Muslim vote in Uttar Pradesh in the 2019 elections was split between the BSP-SP alliance and the Congress Party, which contested the elections on its own. In 2024, the coming together of the SP and the Congress Party led to near-universal Muslim support (92 percent) in that electorally pivotal state. Across states, however, Muslim voters did not uniformly coalesce behind a single party; rather, Muslims tended to back whichever party was perceived to be the strongest challenger to the BJP.\n\nSocial Composition of Representation\n\nFinally, the fourth party system coincided with a shift on a second dimension of social identity\u2014the social composition of India\u2019s elected representatives. In 1989, the year the coalition era began, 47 percent of MPs from the Hindi belt belonged to the upper or intermediate castes, compared to 20 percent from the OBC category. Over the next several elections, the former dipped to 42 percent in 1999 while the latter grew to 25 percent. This was the first year in which the combined share of OBC and SC legislators exceeded that of upper caste and intermediate castes, and the gap widened further in 2004 (see figure 18). By 2014, the upper/intermediate castes regained the upper hand, once more approaching fifty percent of the total. These dominant communities maintained their representational advantage over lower castes through 2019, albeit with shrinking margins.\n\nThe year 2024 witnessed an unprecedented surge in OBC representation, with nearly one in three (31 percent) Hindi belt MPs hailing from this heterogeneous group\u2014a record. In contrast, at 39 percent, the share of upper/intermediate caste MPs from this region was at its lowest level in history. Since 1989, the SC and ST share of Hindi belt MPs has remained constant; SC and ST candidates rarely win outside of legislative constituencies constitutionally reserved for their communities. OBCs, on the other hand, have gained considerable ground. In 2024, Muslim representation stands at 3 percent, half the share seen in 1989 (and well below the group\u2019s share of the population).\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is always difficult to determine the point at which one party system has given way to another. In 2014, for instance, few observers were willing to argue that India had ushered in a new era of political competition, based on the results of a single general election\u2014an argument that became much easier to make five years later in 2019. Similarly, the 2024 general election result could be a harbinger of a return to an era of coalition politics. As the preceding pages demonstrate, however, it would be premature to pass such a judgment based on the latest general election alone.\n\nWhile coalition governance has returned to New Delhi, the BJP retains a position of national strength. It not only has the largest clutch of Lok Sabha seats but also controls a near majority of the Rajya Sabha (with its allies), has gained ground in southern and eastern Indian states, and remains the central gravitational force of Indian politics. While political competition has intensified and fragmentation\u2014at least according to some measures\u2014has grown, the current format of political contestation does not (yet) resemble the pattern of contestation that prevailed during the third party system. Notably, however, the 2024 general elections did resemble an aggregation of state verdicts rather than a national referendum, which represents a clear break with the two previous elections. At the same time, the national political arena cannot simply be reduced to the sum of state contests; Indian voters have demonstrated an ability to distinguish between state and national polls.\n\nLooking ahead, the future trajectory of India\u2019s party system will depend on multiple factors. Above all, three questions loom large.\n\nFirst, to what extent has Modi\u2019s popularity peaked? According to political scientist Devesh Kapur, \u201cincreasing centralization, declining intraparty democracy, and the cutting-to-size of regional leaders who were not subserviently loyal\u201d to Modi all contributed to a hollowing out of the BJP\u2019s traditional strength\u2014its robust, cadre-based party apparatus. According to this view, Modi\u2019s power may have peaked in 2019 and now\u2014as result of shifting political dynamics and the BJP\u2019s own goals\u2014is in decline.\n\nModi\u2019s personal standing is important because public opinion surveys have shown that the prime minister consistently outperforms his party\u2019s brand. According to Lokniti-CSDS, 36 percent of Indians polled in 2014 favored Modi as prime minister, a share that grew to 47 percent in 2019 but declined to 41 percent in 2024. In contrast, the share that preferred Rahul Gandhi for the top job nearly doubled from 14 percent in 2014 to 27 percent in 2024.\n\nWhile it is widely expected that Modi will likely complete fifteen consecutive years as prime minister, the 2029 elections might bring additional changes. At present, there is no clarity as to the succession planning within the BJP. Home Minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath are both widely rumored to be possible successors if Modi were to step aside. Of course, the BJP\u2019s internal deliberations on succession will hinge, at least in part, on the views of other Hindu nationalist groups, including the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)\u2014which serves as the ideological guiding force for the Hindu nationalist movement\u2014and other affiliated groups.\n\nSecond, how sustainable is INDIA, the opposition alliance? The seeds of the alliance date back to June 2023, when sixteen opposition parties first convened to discuss the prospects of constructing a grand opposition alliance that would seek to displace the BJP. In July of that year, more than two dozen parties formally announced a preelection alliance, although the precise seat-sharing arrangements for the 2024 election remained the subject of heated back-and-forth discussions for many months. Some of those arrangements were never consummated, and some alliance partners contested elections against one another in certain states (such as West Bengal and Punjab) while others, like the JD(U) of Nitish Kumar, defected to the BJP-led NDA ahead of the campaign. The ability of the opposition alliance to hang together will significantly impact both the format of political competition in key states and the BJP\u2019s ability to exploit a divided opposition for electoral gain, something it skillfully accomplished in both 2014 and 2019. The degree of opposition unity was significantly higher in 2024 than in the prior two elections.\n\nFinally, to what extent have the views of the median voter in India shifted in a more conservative direction that provides a sustained electoral advantage to the BJP? According to journalist Ravi Agrawal, the conventional wisdom is that by dint of his charisma, Hindu nationalist bona fides, and decisive leadership style, Modi was able to move the median voter in a more conservative direction. But in a perceptive essay published before the 2024 election, Agrawal raises a second possibility: Modi can best be understood not as a supply-side phenomenon but as a demand-side one. Put differently, Modi could be a lagging, rather than leading, indicator of changing political and social attitudes. According to this view, the Indian electorate\u2019s preferences shifted pre-2014, and Modi is merely meeting the median voter where they have settled. If this is correct, it means that the BJP\u2019s political dominance could have greater staying power, irrespective of Modi\u2019s standing or political presence.\n\nFor now, in the immediate aftermath of the 2024 election result, it is clear that several aspects of the fourth party system have been called into question. But in large measure, its foundations remain intact.\n\nAcknowledgments",

      "title": "Essence Of Political Seva Is In Dissolving Ego",
      "content": "Authored by: Hansaji Yogendra\n\nDeepen your understanding of the Bhagavad Gita: Explore chapter 2 with Sri Gaur Prabhu's guidance\n\nThe preamble to the constitution of India begins with the words, \"We, The People of India\". The opening words of the constitution bear testimony to the precedence Indian polity places on the sovereignty of the people in the Union of India. This sovereignty is a natural corollary of the process of free and fair elections through the length and breadth of the country.Political leaders, whether in power or in opposition, bear an acute responsibility towards this objective of making the people sovereign. This becomes particularly significant as the results of elections to Delhi's legislative assembly will be declared today. As Delhi decides, it is paramount that political leaders remember that the people become sovereign when despite the outcome of elections, politicians are deeply aware and committed to seva, service of the people of India.One profound example of exemplary governance from Indic mythology is the story of King Shibi. Renowned for his unwavering commitment to justice and compassion, King Shibi once offered his flesh to save a dove being pursued by a hawk. This act of selflessness was not merely symbolic; it underscored his dedication to protecting the vulnerable at all costs, embodying the true essence of leadership as service and sacrifice. King Shibi's story reminds us that leadership is a sacred duty prioritising the well-being of others above personal gain or convenience.Those who win elections must learn from King Shibi that their mandate is not a trophy but a responsibility, their dharm. Winners must approach their roles with gratitude, recognising the trust placed in them. A leader's dharm is to prioritise the welfare of all, especially the most vulnerable. This requires humility, transparency, and an unwavering commitment to serve. The essence of political seva lies in dissolving one's ego and dedicating every action to the betterment of society. This should guide every decision. Just as a farmer tends to the land with care, leaders must nurture aspirations of the people. They can create an environment where every individual feels valued and heard. Constructive engagement with critics and opponents strengthens the democratic fabric, transforming governance into a collaborative effort.On the other hand, in Indian philosophy, setbacks are opportunities for self-reflection. Those who lose elections are not failures but participants in a greater karmic cycle. Drawing from the ideal of introspection, they must examine their actions and strategies, seeking to understand where they fell short. Like Yudhishthir in the Mahabharat, who faced defeat and exile after the dice game, politicians must use setbacks as moments of deep self-reflection.The role of opposition is as sacred as that of the governing party. Their duty is to hold govt accountable, not out of spite but as an act of seva to the nation. By offering constructive criticism and advocating for the marginalised, they ensure that the voice of every citizen resonates in the corridors of power.While winners carry the immediate responsibility of governance, opposition plays the more important role in shaping a just and equitable society by ensuring govt accountability. Both must remember that their ultimate allegiance is to the people whose trust they seek to honour.",

      "content": "Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis is in India on a 2-day official visit where he met with his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar to strengthen Greek Indian relations.\n\nAthens considers the visit significant, especially in view of Greece\u2019s participation in the United Nations Security Council for the 2025-26 term.\n\nApart from his meeting with the head of Indian diplomacy on Thursday, Gerapetritis is also scheduled to meet with India\u2019s National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval, on Friday.\n\nUpgrading bilateral relations is high on the agenda of Gerapetritis\u2019 visit to New Delhi, as Greece is aiming to increase trade, particularly in construction materials, food and beverages, and renewable energy sources, with a set target to double bilateral trade by 2030. Increasing the volume of Indian investments in Greece is also high on the agenda, as companies from the Asian subcontinent have expressed interest in Greek ports.\n\nA key focus of Athens is the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC), as Greece aspires to become India\u2019s gateway to Europe by serving as the final stop of the initiative. Greece believes its geostrategic location, combined with its role as a regional energy hub and its leading position in maritime trade is a boon for the trade corridor.\n\nThe ceasefire in the Middle East is considered favorable for the project\u2019s planning phase, and Greece maintains strong relations with Middle Eastern nations, including Gulf countries through which the corridor will pass.\n\nReinforcing cooperation in the tourism sector is another key issue of interest in strengthening Greek Indian relations. The 2022 Bilateral Air Services Agreement has already laid the groundwork for direct flights between Indian and Greek cities, and both Indian and Greek airlines have reportedly expressed interest in operating such routes.\n\nAdditionally, Gerapetritis and his Indian counterpart will discuss deeper collaboration on migration matters. The Memorandum of Understanding on Migration and Mobility between Greece and India, currently under negotiation, is regarded as a significant step forward in this regard.",
