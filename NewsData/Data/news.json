      "content": "Why has DeepSeek has sent shockwaves through global tech? Let's try and understand:\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nDeepSeek, a Chinese-made artificial intelligence (AI) model, has shot to the top of Apple Store's downloads, stunning investors and sinking some tech stocks. Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a game changing AI model and the company's low-cost and high-performing technology sent shockwaves through Wall Street, erasing $1 trillion from the Nasdaq\u2019s market value.US President Donald Trump warned Chinese startup DeepSeek is a wake-up call for America's technology industry. US tech giant Nvidia lost over a sixth of its value after the surging popularity of a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) app spooked investors in the US and Europe. DeepSeek said on Monday it will temporarily limit registrations because of \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its software.-Chinese AI startup was released on January 10 and quickly impressed AI geeks before it got the attention of the entire tech industry - and the world. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI chatbot reportedly made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals and has already become the most downloaded free app in the US.-The Chinese AI chatbox's sudden popularity has sent shockwaves in the global tech market. In the US, AI chipmaker Nvidia ended Monday's trading having plunged 16.9% while its rival Broadcom slumped 17.4%. Other tech firms also sank, with Microsoft down 2.14% and Google's owner Alphabet down over 4%, reports BBC.-The world\u2019s 500 richest people, led by Nvidia Corp. co-founder Jensen Huang, lost a combined $108 billion on Monday as a tech-led selloff tied to Chinese AI developer DeepSeek sent major indices plunging, according to Bloomberg. Nvidia, the US chipmaker at the heart of AI infrastructure, suffered the largest one-day market cap loss in history, shedding nearly $600 billion in value. The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.1%, with Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet losing $100 billion and Microsoft dropping $7 billion.-DeepSeek claims its AI assistant needs less data than competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT. It runs on just 2,000 Nvidia H800 chips, making it cheaper to operate. Better yet, the company says its new DeepSeek-R1 costs 20-50 times less than OpenAI's offerings.-California-based Nvidia\u2019s H800 chips, which were designed to comply with US export controls, were freely exported to China until October 2023, when the administration of then-President Joe Biden added them to its list of restricted items.-The speed at which the new Chinese AI app DeepSeek has shaken the technology industry, the markets and the bullish sense of American superiority in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been nothing short of stunning. Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Trump adviser Marc Andreessen described DeepSeek-R1 as \"AI's Sputnik moment\", referencing the 1957 launch of Earth's first artificial satellite by the Soviet Union that stunned the Western world.-Trump reacted quickly on Monday, saying the DeepSeek release \"should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win.\" He argued it could be a \"positive\" for US tech giants, adding: \"instead of spending billions and billions, you'll spend less, and you'll come up with hopefully the same solution.\"-OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said in a post on X that it was \"legit invigorating to have a new competitor.\" He called DeepSeek's R1 \"an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\" and pledged to speed up some OpenAI releases.-DeepSeek, which is based in Hangzhou, was founded in late 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a serial entrepreneur who also runs the hedge fund High-Flyer. Though little known outside China, Liang has an extensive history of combining burgeoning technologies and investing.-The emergence of DeepSeek comes at a critical time for US tech giants, with companies like Apple and Microsoft set to report earnings this week. Investors will be watching closely for signs of how these firms plan to navigate a more competitive AI landscape. If China can produce world-class AI models without access to advanced hardware, the US may need to rethink its approach to maintaining technological leadership.(With inputs from agencies)",

      "content": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially announced the theme of World Health Day 2025, Healthy beginnings, hopeful futures, which will focus on improving maternal and newborn health and survival.\n\nWorld Health Day is marked around the world on 7th April, the anniversary of WHO\u2019s founding in 1948. Each year, it draws attention to a specific health topic of concern to people all over the world.\n\n\u201cThe focus of this campaign comes at a crucial moment, aiming to help countries regain lost progress while showcasing new research and evidence that will enhance the health of women and babies globally,\u201d said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing at WHO. \u201cAs rollbacks to humanitarian assistance jeopardize a critical lifeline for millions, it will also be an opportunity to step up support and collaboration for global health - and deliver hope to those in urgent need of lifesaving care.\u201d\n\nHelping every woman and baby survive and thrive\n\nAccording to the most recent estimates, close to 300 000 women lose their life due to pregnancy or childbirth each year; over 2 million babies die in their first month of life, and around 2 million more are stillborn. This is roughly 1 preventable death every 7 seconds \u2013 losses which bring tremendous sadness and heartache to millions of families around the world.\n\nWhile maternal and newborn deaths occur in all regions, the vast majority are in the poorest countries and those facing conflict and other crises. When health care facilities close, facilities are attacked, access routes denied or supplies disrupted, pregnant women and babies - who need regular access to health services - face severe, often life-threatening risks.\n\nBased on current trends, a staggering 4 out of 5 countries are off track to meet the United Nations\u2019 global targets for improving maternal survival by 2030; 1 in 3 will fail to meet targets for reducing newborn deaths. Current funding constraints could further jeopardize progress, as many programmes providing critical health services have stalled alongside important medical research focused on pregnant and breastfeeding women and children.\n\nThis year\u2019s campaign, which will run until 2026, will urge governments, donors and the health community to invest in proven, high-impact interventions, as part of efforts to improve overall quality of care. These include pregnancy related services to detect complications and lifesaving emergency obstetrics \u2013 noting that the vast majority of maternal and newborn deaths happen during or shortly after birth \u2013 as well as special care for small and preterm babies. Complications relating to prematurity are now the leading cause of death of children under-5 worldwide.\n\nWHO will also highlight the evolving need for health systems to address the many underlying health issues that impact maternal and newborn health. These include not only direct obstetric complications but also mental health conditions, malnutrition (including under and overnutrition as well as nutritional deficiencies), and an increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases.\n\nListening to women and supporting families\n\nMoving beyond actions to save lives, the campaign will urge increased global attention to women\u2019s longer-term health and well-being. This includes advocating for laws and policies that safeguard their health and rights, such as paid maternity leave and other critical employment protections, and access to vital family planning services.\n\n\u201cIt is not sufficient that women survive childbirth, they must also be able to enjoy their lives in good health,\u201d said Dr Pascale Allotey, Director for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research at WHO. \u201cWomen and girls everywhere need access to health providers who listen to their concerns and meet their needs, while ensuring they can plan their fertility, take charge of their futures, and protect their health.\u201d\n\nEfforts are also needed to address the particular risks of climate change for pregnant women and newborns, as evidence shows an association between higher temperatures and preterm births, stillbirth, hypertension and gestational diabetes, as well as infant mortality.\n\nAn investment, not a cost\n\nIn low- and middle-income countries, every US$1 invested in maternal and newborn health is estimated to yield around US$9 to 20 in return. Evidence shows that spending on maternal and newborn health leads to economic development and happier, healthier societies.\n\nAround the world, WHO is supporting essential maternal and newborn health programmes including through:\n\nIntensive support to 55 countries through the Every Woman Every Newborn Everywhere initiative, which is working to expand access to lifesaving emergency obstetric and newborn care units, family planning and other critical services;\n\nGuidance relating to diverse aspects of maternal and newborn health through pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. New recommendations will be published later this year to help clinicians manage postpartum haemorrhage, one of the world\u2019s leading causes of maternal deaths, and noncommunicable diseases in pregnancy;\n\nResearch to improve clinical care options for pregnant women and newborns, including during epidemics when it is critical to ensure high-risk populations are not left behind;\n\nEnsuring maternity and newborn care during humanitarian emergencies, like mobile clinics and health posts in Syria and Sudan, where millions of women and babies would otherwise miss out on lifesaving medical screenings, vaccinations and treatments.\n\nSupport for health workers providing essential care to pregnant women and babies, such as efforts to strengthen the vital role of midwives within health systems through training, accreditation and related guidance.\n\nGet involved\n\nHere\u2019s what you can do to support the campaign",

      "title": "India: The unsung hero of global health security in a world of rising costs",
      "content": "India's pivotal role in global health security has never been more vital, especially in light of rising healthcare costs that are putting immense pressure on households, governments, insurers and healthcare providers worldwide. In 2022, global healthcare spending reached an alarming $9.8 tn, accounting for around 10% of global GDP, according to WHO.Escalating costs of medicines are not just a financial burden. They are also exacerbating inequities in healthcare access, particularly in developing countries, where life-saving treatments remain out of reach for many.With global pharma expenditures on track to rise at CAGR of 5-8%, reaching $2.3 tn by 2028, the financial strain on health systems will only intensify. In 2023, global spending on biopharmaceuticals reached $1.4 tn. WHO estimates that one-third of the global population lacks access to essential medicines, leading to millions of preventable deaths each year. Without the vital contributions of India's generics and biosimilars, this crisis would be far more severe. By ensuring availability, affordability and accessibility of critical medicines, India plays an indispensable role in securing health for people worldwide.The global generic drugs market was valued at about $420 bn in 2023. It's expected to exceed $600 bn by 2030. As supplier of 20% of the world's generic medicines, India is at the forefront of delivering affordable healthcare solutions . Its contributions have been transformative in both developing and developed nations.India provides 40% of the US' generic drug supply and meets 25% of Britain's needs. In the US, where healthcare costs are among the highest globally, generics and biosimilars have expanded access to essential treatments.In 2023, while generics and biosimilars accounted for 90% of all prescriptions in the US, they represented just 18% of total drug spending, underscoring their role in improving access to therapies while curbing costs. Over the last decade, they have saved the US healthcare system more than $3 tn, ensuring essential treatments reach more patients without imposing significant financial burdens.India's strength in the pharma sector is rooted in its world-class scientific community, cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities and cost-effective production methods. As the world's third-largest producer of pharmaceuticals by volume, India exports medicines to more than 200 countries.Beyond generics, India has emerged as a leader in biosimilars - affordable alternatives to biologic drugs that treat complex conditions like cancer and autoimmune diseases. The biosimilars market is expected to quadruple by 2030, as patents for originator biologics expire. India's pharma companies are spearheading development of these vital treatments, ensuring that millions of patients worldwide have access to life-saving therapies at a fraction of the cost.India's expertise in R&D, particularly in chemistry and biochemistry, also positions the country to be a cost-effective innovator in creating first-in-class novel therapies, including gene- and cell-based treatments. Its growing proficiency in genomics, microbiomes and AI-powered precision medicine is set to drive the next wave of breakthroughs in personalised healthcare.India's contribution to global health security is further amplified by its leadership in vaccine production. Known as the 'vaccine capital of the world', India manufactures over 60% of the world's vaccines. The country's robust vaccine-manufacturing infra, advanced scientific expertise and cost- effective production processes have enabled it to deliver millions of doses to combat infectious diseases such as polio, measles and Covid. Its role in the global vaccine supply chain has been critical in addressing global health emergencies.India's leadership in generics and biosimilars has not only transformed healthcare access but also strengthened the resilience of global supply chains, ensuring the consistent availability of affordable medicines. In FY24, India's pharma exports grew by nearly 10%, reaching $28 bn. The US remains India's largest market, importing over 31% of this total, reflecting India's essential role in meeting global medicinal needs.India isn't just the 'pharmacy of the world'. It's also the backbone of a stable, resilient and equitable global healthcare system. As the world faces growing health challenges, its leadership in pharma, coupled with strengthened international collaborations and continued innovation, will ensure health security for all.",

      "title": "What\u2019s next for the World Health Organization? US exit could reshape agency",
      "content": "Few health-policy experts were surprised when US President Donald Trump last month announced that he would pull the United States out of the World Health Organization (WHO). Nor were many shocked when, a few days later, Trump said that he could reconsider the withdrawal if certain unspecified conditions were met. What might happen next is harder to predict.\n\n\u201cHis general strategy is to detonate things and then do whatever\u2019s advantageous to him,\u201d says Jesse Bump, a global-health-policy researcher at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \u201cBut in the case of WHO, it\u2019s really difficult to imagine anything that would be personally advantageous to him in the short run.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump\u2019s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nThe US withdrawal will not officially happen until January 2026, so there will be months of uncertainty over budgets and strategic direction at the near-80-year-old agency. Set up by the United Nations, the organization\u2019s goals include expanding universal health coverage and coordinating the world\u2019s response to health emergencies.\n\nNature spoke to senior figures in global health to gauge what might be next for the WHO and the field.\n\nBudget uncertainty hinders work\n\nSome remain optimistic about the WHO\u2019s future. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty robust organization and I think the WHO will weather this,\u201d says Robert Yates, a political-health economist at the London School of Economics and Political Science. \u201cAnd if other Western powers step up to defend it and put more money into it, then it might come out a bit stronger.\u201d\n\nBut given that the United States contributes about 18% of the WHO annual budget of roughly US$3.4 billion, the uncertainty is already having an impact. Opening the WHO executive board meeting this month, director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that, even before Trump\u2019s executive order, the WHO was planning to shrink spending because of a shortfall caused by economic difficulties in many donor countries. \u201cThe US announcement has made the situation more acute, and we have announced a set of measures with immediate effect,\u201d he said.\n\nThe result is that \u201cWHO staff are grounded\u201d says Ilona Kickbusch, a political scientist who specializes in health at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. \u201cNearly every meeting is cancelled and travel to countries is cancelled.\u201d\n\nIs bird flu spreading among people? Data gaps leave researchers in the dark\n\nThat\u2019s affecting the agency\u2019s work, she adds. \u201cIf you are trying to negotiate a new set of standards or something like that it helps to be in one room.\u201d\n\nProjects that the WHO is currently working on include a Europe-wide push to improve mental-health services and work on the ground after a surge of violence in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, providing medical assistance and supplies, supporting health workers and coordinating the emergency response.\n\nHow events will play out is hard to judge, she adds, because the WHO\u2019s operations are more complex than its critics often realize. \u201cFor Trump, WHO is an international bureaucracy in Geneva,\u201d Kickbusch says. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually incredibly complicated.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s complaints about the WHO include its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the slow pace of reform and what his executive order cites as an \u201cinability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states\u201d.\n\nRegional offices might still be funded\n\nMuch of the WHO\u2019s work is routed through six regional offices. One of these, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), receives a separate funding stream from the US government, which could continue to be paid even after the US withdraws from the WHO proper.\n\n\u201cThere are other regional groups which the US may choose to fund bilaterally and therefore not fund through WHO,\u201d says David Heymann, an infectious-disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. There are also dozens of designated WHO collaborating centres that conduct research at US academic institutions to support the agency\u2019s programmes. These could continue to work with the WHO to provide technical support, he adds.\n\nWorld Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced plans for the organization to reduce spending.Credit: Lian Yi/Xinhua/Alamy\n\nBeyond the financial impacts, any US withdrawal \u201csets a very poor example for other countries\u201d, he says. Argentina also said this month that it will leave the organization.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei accused the WHO of promoting \u201cendless lockdowns without scientific support\u201d among other claims. But Milei said that Argentina would remain part of the PAHO. Still, leaving the WHO would mean that Argentina loses international support for future pandemics and other global-health problems, says Adolfo Rubinstein, a former health minister of Argentina. \u201cThis is terrible news.\u201d\n\nOther populist leaders could follow, says Lawrence Gostin, who directs the WHO Collaborating Center for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University in Washington DC. \u201cBut I expect the vast majority of countries to remain members and perhaps coalesce around WHO.\u201d\n\nDisease-monitoring gaps raise risks",

      "title": "Sports Tourism Market Set to Reach USD 1,803.7 Billion by 2030, Fueling Economic Growth and Expanding Global Reach: Here Is The Latest News",
      "content": "Sports Tourism Market Set to Reach USD 1,803.7 Billion by 2030, Fueling Economic Growth and Expanding Global Reach: Here Is The Latest News\n\nThe global sports tourism market, valued at $323.4 billion in 2020, is projected to grow significantly, reaching $1,803.7 billion by 2030. This marks a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.1% from 2021 to 2030. Sports tourism involves traveling to observe or participate in a sporting event, and it has surged in popularity due to increased global interest in sports and international events. The market is benefiting from both domestic and international tourism, offering substantial economic benefits to regions that host major sporting events.\n\nThe Growth of Sports Tourism\n\nSports tourism encompasses three major types: sports event tourism, celebrity and nostalgia sports tourism, and active sport tourism. As the global demand for these events increases, so does the need for facilities and services that cater to the influx of tourists. Sports tourism has helped regions grow economically by generating revenue from a range of sectors, including hospitality, transportation, and retail.\n\nTourist spending on sporting events often extends beyond just ticket sales, creating opportunities for hotels, restaurants, and shops to boost their earnings. In locations that host major tournaments or sporting competitions, efforts to improve infrastructure\u2014such as upgrading stadiums, creating fan zones, and enhancing transportation\u2014further contribute to tourism development.\n\nKey Drivers of the Sports Tourism Market\n\nOne of the primary factors driving the growth of sports tourism is the increasing number of global sporting events. Governments and private organizations are investing heavily in sports infrastructure to meet the growing demand for larger events. The rise in the number of events\u2014both domestic and international\u2014helps to draw more spectators, thereby increasing demand for hotels, restaurants, and travel services in host cities.\n\nFootball (soccer) remains the leading product segment in the sports tourism market. The sport\u2019s popularity continues to drive a substantial share of global tourism, from international tournaments to local league matches. Football\u2019s ability to attract millions of fans from all over the world has cemented its place as the highest revenue-generating segment in sports tourism.\n\nSimilarly, cricket, motorsports, and tennis also contribute significantly to the market, with their own growing fan bases and international competitions that draw fans from around the globe. As the sports tourism market continues to expand, so does the demand for related services, including ticketing, sports packages, and travel services.\n\nSegmentation by Market Type\n\nSports tourism is categorized into domestic and international segments, with the domestic segment being the largest contributor to market revenue. Domestic tourism benefits from investments in local sports facilities, public transportation, and hospitality, as well as government policies that promote local tourism and infrastructure development. The international segment has also witnessed significant growth, particularly with global sporting events such as the Olympics, FIFA World Cup, and Formula 1 races, which attract tourists from countries around the world.\n\nThe market is further divided into active and passive categories. Active sports tourism involves travelers who participate in sporting activities, such as running, skiing, or biking. Passive sports tourism, on the other hand, pertains to travelers who visit destinations to watch sporting events. The passive category holds the largest share, largely due to the popularity of major events that attract vast numbers of spectators.\n\nEconomic Impact and Infrastructure Development\n\nAs sports tourism grows, its economic impact is undeniable. Increased tourism helps to generate additional revenue through ticket sales, accommodation, food services, and local retail. Many cities are investing in the expansion of sporting venues to accommodate the rising number of attendees and ensure that the infrastructure can handle the surge in demand.\n\nAdditionally, governments and organizations are investing in the creation of fan zones and related events to improve the fan experience. These zones often feature live broadcasts of matches, merchandise shops, and interactive experiences, further boosting local economies. Many sports tourism stakeholders are focusing on growing the sports fan base by expanding their reach through marketing efforts and partnerships.\n\nChallenges Facing the Market\n\nWhile the outlook for sports tourism is overwhelmingly positive, there are challenges to consider. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the industry, with event cancellations, travel restrictions, and disruptions to sports schedules causing a slowdown in tourism activities. The outbreak led to widespread closures of venues, event cancellations, and travel bans that affected the global sports tourism market. Despite this, the sector is rebounding, and future growth remains strong.\n\nOne of the ongoing challenges is the need for continued investment in infrastructure to meet the demand from tourists. The capacity of venues to accommodate large crowds is crucial, and many organizations are working on expanding seating capacities to generate additional revenue from ticket sales. Lack of financial support for sports teams and events could result in cancellations, which may temporarily hinder the market\u2019s growth.\n\nMarket Trends and Future Prospects\n\nAs more fan zones are established around major events, sports tourism is set to evolve. These fan zones are not limited to host cities and can be found in various locations, further boosting tourism in regions not directly involved in the event. This is a significant opportunity for cities and businesses to tap into the growing sports tourism market.\n\nThe global sports tourism market is expected to continue to thrive due to the increasing number of sporting events and the growing number of tourists seeking to participate in or watch these events. With an estimated value of $1.8 trillion by 2030, the sports tourism sector will play an essential role in the global travel and tourism industry.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe sports tourism market is on a strong growth trajectory, driven by increasing sporting events and an expanding global fan base. Football continues to dominate, but other sports such as cricket, tennis, and motorsports are also seeing rapid growth in their fan engagement. Investments in infrastructure, the development of fan zones, and the expansion of sporting events worldwide are essential to sustaining this growth.\n\nFor regions and cities hosting these events, sports tourism presents a lucrative opportunity for economic development. With a projected CAGR of 16.1%, the global sports tourism market will continue to generate significant revenue, benefiting both the tourism and sports industries alike.\n\nShare On:",

      "title": "Establishing New World Finance: Broader Impact Of Bitcoin On Global Economy",
      "content": "By Roshan Aslam\n\nThe emergence of Bitcoin was closely followed by the global economic crisis in 2008. As conventional currencies underperformed and came under significant stress, the global economy became subject to massive losses. However, while the first public appearance of Bitcoin was not considered a significant motivator for the global economy, the narrative gradually shifted in the next decade, making Bitcoin the face of the new world of finance that we know now.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s move to prominence has essentially been the amalgamation of numerous external and internal factors. To begin with, Bitcoin\u2019s emergence led to significant innovations in blockchain technology, an aspect that has transformed finance as we perceived before 2009, leading to significant technological development.\n\nAs BTC secures its position as the world\u2019s most significant risk asset and as one of the best hedges against inflation, its role in introducing concepts like decentralisation, transaction speed, transparency and digital payments has been revolutionary. These aspects have been significant drivers of adoption by retail traders, whales and institutional investors \u2014 all aspects that have impacted the global economy. It has led the global governments to finally make their move into the domain, and subsequent considerate economic policies have been created.\n\nHowever, it must be understood that while it has been more than a decade since Bitcoin came into circulation, it has yet to reach the pinnacle of its potential. Its future role in economic impact remains a topic of discussion among global economists, however, its role so far has been evident in shifting perspectives and narratives in the global economy till now.\n\nBlockchain & Decentralisation\n\nArguably the most significant of Bitcoin\u2019s impact on the world, Blockchain technology received a massive boost following Bitcoin\u2019s public release in 2009. As the foundation behind Bitcoin, significant research & development in Blockchain led to unprecedented innovations in global finance, introducing new concepts like decentralisation.\n\nWhile it was perceived as unviable at the time, Blockchain\u2019s decentralised nature has since made considerable inroads, transforming global finance as we know it. For instance, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation stands at over $1.90 trillion, an aspect that uniquely positions it as a new tool that addresses value creation for stakeholders across levels \u2014 retail traders, Whales, institutional investors and governments.\n\nThis notion has been supported by the recently inaugurated US President Donald Trump, who has vowed to make the US the Bitcoin capital of the world and create Bitcoin reserves similar to dollar and energy reserves that can be used as legal tenders for transactions.\n\nThe emergence of decentralisation through Blockchain has transformed cross-border transactions with speed, affordability and transparency, marking a milestone for establishing new world finance for the years to come.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\nThe emergence of Bitcoin has led to the creation of a completely new global industry through Blockchain and the subsequent release of other tokens. This has diversified conventional finance, leading to the generation of new employment opportunities. With an industry that had a valuation of $2.7 trillion in 2024, the sector is expected to be valued at $6.2 trillion by 2033, and the impact on generating new job roles has been massive.\n\nThis has directly impacted the global economy, helping individuals with several new avenues for value creation. Recent reports also suggest that Bitcoin and Blockchain-related jobs pay over 150 per cent in contrast to other jobs, indicating the demand and growth prospects for global economies.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin-related income has been taxed significantly throughout the world, an aspect that has been directly contributing towards both national and global economies.\n\nFor instance, the Government of India levies a 30 per cent tax on gains and 1 per cent TDS on Bitcoin transactions. Similarly, the United Kingdom taxes Bitcoin-related gains between 10 per cent-20 per cent depending on factors, the US has a policy of taxing Bitcoin at 10 per cent-37 per cent for the short term and 0 per cent to 20 per cent for the long term. While high tax slabs are often considered an obstacle to Bitcoin adoption, their role in supporting the economy cannot also be undermined.\n\nCoupled with this, Bitcoin and the subsequent emergence of Blockchain technology have automated and digitised financial transactions that can be monitored through a ledger which cannot be manipulated by anyone.\n\nAlso, Decentralised Finance (DeFi) offers more speed for transactions in a more cost-saving approach, also reducing the chance of fraud. This offers to bring the globally unbanked population under a single umbrella, enhancing the accessibility of financial services irrespective of location and geography. These practical approaches enhance the functionalities of the new-age finance led by Bitcoin, boosting the growth of the global economy.\n\nSupporting Legal Tenders\n\nInflation is a key concern in finance, and numerous countries are suffering from their unstable or inflated legal tenders. Furthermore, the global dependence on the US Dollar for trade, its predetermined regulations and US sanctions on numerous countries mean that confidence in the US banking system has reduced significantly in the past few decades.\n\nFor these countries, Bitcoin offers a new avenue, while hedging against inflation and supporting the national economies with value creation. Bitcoin\u2019s usage has witnessed a considerable increase in nations like Venezuela and Lebanon, where the legal tender has been facing hyperinflation, and using Bitcoin as an alternative for financial transactions has extended a lifeline.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s overall economic impact has been massive globally, and as it evolves, economic policies surrounding the growth of Bitcoin are expected to be introduced around the world. However, the true extent of its impact on the global economy is still to be witnessed, but establishing a new world economy should be the bare minimum that can be expected in the years to come.\n\n(The author is the Co-Founder & CEO of GoSats)\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions, beliefs, and views expressed by the various authors and forum participants on this website are personal and do not reflect the opinions, beliefs, and views of ABP Network Pvt.

      "title": "Global market crash: From Asian markets to crypto prices, US recession fears jolt financial markets globally",
      "content": "Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, witnessed a heavy sell-off on Monday as the rout in global equities intensified amid US recession concerns and escalating the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.\n\nThe global equity markets plummeted as the sell-off was fuelled by growing concerns that the US economy is slowing and the Federal Reserve is behind the curve with policy support. Data showed the US jobs market weakening, which triggered a closely watched recession indicator.\n\n\u201cThis sell off is more of a short term volatility by way of profit booking and is no indicator of any long term panic mode set in the Indian equities. For investors looking at entering the equity market, a staggered entry during volatile periods can be considered,\u201d said Tanvi Kanchan, Head - UAE Business & Strategy, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.\n\nThe repercussions were witnessed in markets across the globe - from Asian equity markets, to currency markets to bitcoin prices. Here\u2019s a look at global markets:\n\nIndian stock market Indian stock market benchmark indices Nifty 50 and Sensex crashed more than 3% each as sell-off intensified across the board. Sensex traded 2,450.32 points, or 3.03%, lower at 78,531.63, while Nifty 50 tumbled 696.35 points, or 2.82%, to 24,021.35.\n\nInvestors lost nearly \u20b915 lakh crore in a session amid the stock market crash today as the overall market capitalisation of the BSE-listed companies dropped to nearly \u20b9442 lakh crore from nearly \u20b9457 lakh crore in the previous session.\n\nAlso Read | Sensex crashes 3%; 5 factors why Indian stock market is falling today\n\nAsian Markets Japan\u2019s stock market tumbled with the benchmark indices falling more than 20% from their record highs, confirming a bear market, as sell-off continued from last week.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index plunged 12.40%, or 4,451.28 points, to 31,458.42 -- its largest points drop in history -- while the broader Topix index declined 12.23%, or 310.45 points, to 2,227.15.\n\nA resurgent yen weighed on the Japanese stock markets. The yen surged to 141.73 against the dollar, a level not seen since early January, from 146.52 yen in New York on Friday.\n\nAmong other Asian markets, South Korea\u2019s Kospi plunged 8.1% before trading was halted for 20 minutes due to the exchange\u2019s circuit breakers. The Kosdaq dropped 11.71%.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s benchmark, Taiwan Weighted Index declined more than 8% amid selling in technology and real estate stocks. Hong Kong Hang Seng index fell 1.61%, while mainland China\u2019s CSI 300 declined 0.48%.\n\nUS Stock Futures US stock futures fell following a drop on Wall Street last week that led the Nasdaq Composite dropping into correction territory. Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled more than 6% and S&P 500 contracts were down more than 3%. Futures of Dow Jones plunged over 1%.\n\nBond Market India government bond yields fell on Monday tracking a sharp decline in US peers amid rising bets of aggressive rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.\n\nThe domestic benchmark 10-year yield was at 6.8597%, lowest level since March 31, 2022, compared with its previous close of 6.8945%.\n\nUS Treasury yields nosedived on Friday. The US 10-year yield dropped to the lowest level since December and extended decline in Asian hours on Monday, Reuters reported. It was last at 6.7565% in Asian hours, while the 2-year yield was at 3.8216%.\n\nAlso Read | Rupee opens at record low of 83.78 against the US dollar\n\nCurrency Market Indian rupee fell to an all-time low on Monday weighed down by the stock market crash as concerns over a US recession spurred outflows from local equities amid a global stocks sell-off. The rupee declined to a record low of 83.82 against the US dollar and was last quoted at 83.8125, down about 0.1% from its close at 83.75 on Friday.\n\nJapanese yen, a safe-haven and carry-funding favourite, traded at 143, up 2.3% versus the dollar, and at levels last seen on January 2, Reuters reported. The yen has rallied 10% against the dollar in just over three weeks, driven in part by the Bank of Japan\u2019s interest rate rise last week and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.\n\nCryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies also reeled under heavy selling amid a risk aversion in global markets on Monday, with the Bitcoin prices falling around 15%.\n\nTop token Bitcoin price traded 15.5% lower at $51,323.58, adding to a 13.1% drop last week that was the worst since the period when the FTX exchange imploded. Ethereum price declined 22.3% to $2,262. Most other major cryptocurrencies were deeply in the red.\n\nGold Rate Today Gold prices rose on Monday on safe-haven demand as the global financial markets are in a risk-averse mode. Spot gold rose 0.14% to $2,446.83 per ounce, after falling 1% earlier in the session. US gold futures rose 0.8% to $2,488.50.\n\nMCX gold rate today traded 0.19% higher at \u20b969,925 per 10 grams, while MCX silver price fell 0.39% to \u20b982,168 per kg.\n\n(With inputs from Reuters)",

      "title": "Donald Trump introduces new cryptocurrency World Liberty Financial: Can it \u2018make finance great again\u2019?",
      "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s Crypto Shift\n\nWhat is World Liberty Financial\n\nWorld Liberty Financial\n\nA Controversial Business Launch amid Election\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nFormer President Donald Trump , accompanied by his two eldest sons and several cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, announced a new digital currency initiative, World Liberty Financial , during a livestream event on Monday. This marks a dramatic shift in Trump\u2019s stance on cryptocurrencies, as he had previously been critical of digital currencies during his earlier campaigns. The timing of the announcement, just months ahead of the U.S. presidential election, has raised eyebrows among supporters and critics alike.During the livestream on X (formerly Twitter), Trump, who was joined by his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump , as well as entrepreneurs Chase Herro and Zachary Folkman , expressed the need to get involved in the growing digital currency market. \u201cCrypto is one of those things we have to do. Whether we like it or not, I have to do it,\u201d Trump said.His remarks signal a complete turnaround from his previous position when he had called cryptocurrencies a \u201cscam\u201d and warned against their widespread adoption. Now, he seems to embrace the technology, positioning himself as a champion of digital assets. In his speech, Trump argued that the United States must take a leadership role in the global cryptocurrency industry to remain competitive. He warned that if the U.S. doesn\u2019t act quickly, other nations could dominate. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it, China will. And if we\u2019re not the biggest, we won\u2019t be the best,\u201d Trump explained during a conversation with crypto investor Farokh Sarmad.World Liberty Financial is set to operate as a cryptocurrency platform primarily focused on stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to a stable value, usually $1. The platform is expected to provide services like borrowing and lending, with a new cryptocurrency named $WLFI at its core.Though Trump provided little detail about the venture\u2019s operational specifics, he highlighted the roles his children will play in the project. Trump himself is titled the \u201cchief crypto advocate,\u201d while his youngest son, Barron Trump, has been labeled the \u201cDeFi visionary.\u201d Both Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump will serve as \"web3 ambassadors.\" Each family member's role, according to the white paper of the project, is designed to leverage their influence in promoting the platform\u2019s growth.The venture was developed with the assistance of real estate magnate Steve Witkoff and Puerto Rico-based AMG Software Solutions , which filed a trademark for the platform in July. Despite the excitement surrounding the project, Trump and his team have remained tight-lipped about its funding, formation, and specific services.Ethical Concerns and Legal HurdlesWhile World Liberty Financial aims to attract investors with its promise of stablecoin-driven financial services, the platform will be limited to accredited U.S. investors due to regulatory challenges. Folkman, one of the entrepreneurs behind the venture, jokingly commented during the livestream, \u201cThe lawyers are getting nervous back there\u2026 They\u2019re sweating.\u201dThe launch of World Liberty Financial has also sparked ethical concerns, especially given Trump\u2019s potential return to the White House. Ethics experts worry that Trump\u2019s involvement in the cryptocurrency industry could lead to conflicts of interest if he wins the presidency. Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, told The New York Times, \u201cHe would be able to push regulatory agencies to favor businesses he is involved in.\u201dAs Trump positions himself as a pro-crypto candidate, some worry that his business ventures may influence his policy decisions, should he regain the presidency. Earlier this month, Trump promised to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet,\u201d vowing to reduce federal regulations on digital currencies. He even proposed the creation of a national strategic reserve of Bitcoin, further emphasizing his commitment to advancing the digital asset market.Launching a new business venture during an election campaign is unusual for any presidential candidate, yet Trump\u2019s move appears to be a calculated attempt to attract digital asset advocates and investors. Trump\u2019s eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have been promoting World Liberty Financial in recent weeks, with both promising that the platform will \u201ctransform\u201d the digital finance world, though they have yet to provide specific details.Chase Herro, one of the entrepreneurs involved in the project, emphasized the accessibility World Liberty Financial would offer to investors. \"This country\u2019s been so good to me, and crypto has been so good to me,\" Herro said, underscoring the platform\u2019s potential impact on financial markets.Trump's pivot toward cryptocurrency has raised questions among some of his supporters in the financial and political sectors, especially given the lack of transparency regarding the project\u2019s financial structure and objectives. Nevertheless, Trump\u2019s embrace of the cryptocurrency space is seen as part of a broader strategy to modernize his campaign platform and appeal to tech-savvy voters.As the U.S. cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, Donald Trump\u2019s entry into the space through World Liberty Financial could signal a new direction for his campaign. The venture may give Trump an edge with digital asset advocates, but it also opens the door to ethical and regulatory scrutiny. How this move will play out in the lead-up to Election Day remains uncertain, but it has certainly added a new dimension to Trump\u2019s political and business profile.",

      "title": "The Role of Cryptocurrencies in Emerging Economies",
      "content": "In recent years, cryptocurrencies have emerged as a revolutionary force in global finance, with emerging economies playing a significant role in this shift. From providing financial inclusion to improving cross-border transactions, digital currencies have the potential to reshape economies that face structural financial challenges. The role of cryptocurrencies in emerging economies is multifaceted, offering both opportunities and challenges. In this article, we explore how cryptocurrencies are impacting these economies and why their adoption continues to grow.\n\nCryptocurrencies and Financial Inclusion in Emerging Economies\n\nOne of the primary benefits of cryptocurrencies is their ability to promote financial inclusion. In many emerging economies, a large portion of the population remains unbanked due to limited access to financial institutions. According to the World Bank, around 1.7 billion people worldwide are unbanked. Cryptocurrencies can offer an alternative to traditional banking, enabling individuals to participate in the digital economy. All that is needed to engage with digital assets is a smartphone and an internet connection. This means that even in rural areas with little to no banking infrastructure, individuals can access global financial systems, send and receive payments, and store wealth in a decentralized manner.\n\nCross-Border Transactions and Remittances\n\nRemittances represent a critical source of income for many families in emerging economies. In countries such as Mexico, India, and the Philippines, remittances account for a significant portion of the GDP. However, traditional remittance services are often expensive, with high transaction fees and lengthy processing times. Cryptocurrencies offer a cheaper and faster alternative for cross-border transactions.\n\nUsing blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies allow for near-instantaneous and low-cost international transfers. This can have a massive impact on families who rely on remittances as their primary source of income. With cryptocurrencies, they can send money with minimal fees, often bypassing the traditional banking system, which can be slow and expensive.\n\nFor those interested in exploring digital assets, now might be the right time to buy Solana (SOL), one of the most promising cryptocurrencies in the market, known for its scalability and low transaction costs. As the adoption of blockchain technology grows, Solana\u2019s potential could make it a key player in shaping the future of finance in emerging economies.For example, many people in Venezuela have turned to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to circumvent hyperinflation, allowing them to preserve their wealth in assets not subject to the devaluation of the local currency. In many emerging economies, the appeal of a more stable store of value and a quicker means of transferring funds is driving the adoption of digital currencies.\n\nHedging Against Inflation\n\nInflation is a persistent issue in many emerging economies, where local currencies are often subject to extreme volatility or devaluation. In countries with high inflation rates, such as Argentina and Zimbabwe, citizens are increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies to protect their wealth. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which have a capped supply, are viewed as a hedge against inflation, providing a stable store of value in times of economic uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin, for example, has been dubbed \u201cdigital gold\u201d due to its scarcity, which contrasts with fiat currencies that can be printed endlessly by central banks. In countries with hyperinflation, the ability to hold and trade in Bitcoin can help individuals maintain their purchasing power, providing a level of financial stability in an otherwise volatile environment.\n\nChallenges and Risks of Cryptocurrencies in Emerging Economies\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies offer significant benefits, they also come with risks, especially in emerging economies. One of the primary challenges is the volatility of digital assets. Cryptocurrencies are known for their price fluctuations, which can be both an opportunity and a risk. For people in countries with fragile economies, the price swings can lead to substantial financial losses if investments are not carefully managed.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of regulation in many emerging economies raises concerns about the potential for misuse of cryptocurrencies. Without proper oversight, digital currencies can be used for illegal activities, such as money laundering, fraud, and tax evasion. This makes it difficult for governments to protect consumers and ensure the integrity of financial systems.\n\nMoreover, the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining has been a subject of debate. Mining operations, particularly for energy-intensive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, consume vast amounts of electricity, which contributes to carbon emissions. This could become an issue in countries already struggling with energy shortages or environmental challenges.\n\nGovernment Regulation and Adoption of Cryptocurrencies\n\nGovernments in emerging economies have taken varied approaches to cryptocurrencies. Some countries have embraced digital currencies, recognizing their potential to stimulate economic growth and financial inclusion, while others have imposed strict regulations or outright bans.\n\nFor instance, El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, becoming the first country to do so. The government hopes to increase financial inclusion and attract foreign investment by adopting cryptocurrencies. However, the move has been controversial, with some citizens expressing concerns about the volatility and the lack of understanding regarding digital assets.\n\nIn contrast, countries like China have taken a more restrictive stance on cryptocurrencies, imposing bans on crypto trading and mining operations. The Chinese government has cited concerns over financial stability and the environmental impact of mining. However, other nations, such as Brazil and India, are exploring regulatory frameworks that would allow cryptocurrencies to thrive while ensuring consumer protection.\n\nThe Future of Cryptocurrencies in Emerging Economies\n\nAs cryptocurrencies continue to gain traction in emerging economies, the future appears promising, albeit complex. Financial inclusion, faster cross-border transactions, and protection against inflation are key drivers of their adoption. However, the volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and environmental concerns associated with digital currencies will need to be addressed for sustainable growth.\n\nMoreover, as blockchain technology evolves, we can expect more innovations that will make cryptocurrencies more accessible, efficient, and secure for users in developing nations. Education and awareness about how to use digital assets safely will also play a crucial role in increasing adoption and ensuring that people are able to reap the full benefits of cryptocurrencies.\n\nConclusion\n\nCryptocurrencies are playing an increasingly important role in the financial landscape of emerging economies. They offer solutions to long-standing problems such as financial exclusion, high remittance fees, and inflation, while also creating new opportunities for economic growth. However, the risks associated with volatility, regulation, and environmental impact must be carefully managed to ensure their sustainable adoption.\n\nAs the global economy continues to embrace digital currencies, emerging economies are likely to benefit the most from this new era of finance. Whether it\u2019s through enabling cross-border payments, offering a hedge against inflation, or creating new opportunities for unbanked populations, cryptocurrencies have the potential to transform these economies for the better.",

      "content": "Tensions between the world's two largest economies have escalated over the last several years. Florence Lo | Reuters\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China is trying yet again to boost foreign investment, amid geopolitical tensions and businesses' calls for more concrete actions. On Feb. 19, authorities published a \"2025 action plan for stabilizing foreign investment\" to make it easier for foreign capital to invest in domestic telecommunication and biotechnology industries, according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese. The document called for clearer standards in government procurement \u2014 a major issue for foreign businesses in China \u2014 and for the development of a plan to gradually allow foreign investment in the education and culture sectors. \"We are looking forward to see this implemented in a manner that delivers tangible benefits for our members,\" Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said in a statement Thursday. The chamber pointed out that China has already mentioned plans to open up telecommunications, health care, education and culture to foreign investment. Greater clarity on public procurement requirements is a \"notable positive,\" the chamber said, noting that \"if fully implemented,\" it could benefit foreign companies that have invested heavily to localize their production in China.\n\nwatch now\n\nChina's latest action plan was released around the same time the Commerce Ministry disclosed that foreign direct investment in January fell by 13.4% to 97.59 billion yuan ($13.46 billion). That was after FDI plunged by 27.1% in 2024 and dropped by 8% in 2023, after at least eight straight years of annual growth, according to official data available through Wind Information. All regions should \"ensure that all the measures are implemented in 2025, and effectively boost foreign investment confidence,\" the plan said. The Ministry of Commerce and National Development and Reform Commission \u2014 the economic planning agency \u2014 jointly released the action plan through the government's executive body, the State Council. Officials from the Commerce Ministry emphasized in a press conference Thursday that the action plan would be implemented by the end of 2025, and that details on subsequent supportive measures would come soon. \"We appreciate the Chinese government's recognition of the vital role foreign companies play in the economy,\" Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said in a statement. \"We look forward to further discussions on the key challenges our members face and the steps needed to ensure a more level playing field for market access.\" AmCham China's latest survey of members, released last month, found that a record share are considering or have started diversifying manufacturing or sourcing away from China. The prior year's survey had found members were finding it harder to make money in China than before the Covid-19 pandemic. Consumer spending in China has remained lackluster since the pandemic, with retail sales only growing by the low single digits in recent months. Tensions with the U.S. have meanwhile escalated as the White House has restricted Chinese access to advanced technology and levied tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\n'A very strong signal'",

      "title": "Speech: Geopolitics and its Impact on Global Trade and the Dollar",
      "content": "Geopolitics and its Impact on Global Trade and the Dollar\n\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\n\nGlobal economic ties are changing in ways we have not seen since the end of the Cold War.\n\nAfter years of shocks\u2014including the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2014countries are reevaluating their trading partners based on economic and national security concerns. Foreign direct investment flows are also being re-directed along geopolitical lines. Some countries are reevaluating their heavy reliance on the dollar in their international transactions and reserve holdings.\n\nAll of this is not necessarily bad. Given the recent history of events, policymakers are increasingly\u2014and justifiably\u2014focused on building economic resilience. But if the trend continues, we could see a broad retreat from global rules of engagement and, with it, a significant reversal of the gains from economic integration.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at how far we have gone down that route already. New trade restrictions have increased sharply\u2014more than tripling since 2019\u2014while financial sanctions have also expanded. The geopolitical risk index has spiked in 2022 following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAnd private sector concerns about fragmentation\u2014gauged by the number of mentions in corporate earnings calls\u2014have surged.\n\nDespite these trends, there are not yet clear signs of deglobalization at the aggregate level. Since around the time of the global financial crisis, when the 1990s-early 2000s hyper-globalization came to an end, the ratio of goods trade to GDP has been roughly stable\u2014fluctuating between 41 and 48 percent.\n\nBut under the surface, there are increasing signs of fragmentation. Trade and investment flows are being redirected along geopolitical lines.\n\nFor example, China\u2019s share in U.S. imports declined by 8 percentage points between 2017 and 2023 following a flare-up in trade tensions. During the same period, the U.S. share in China\u2019s exports dropped by about 4 percentage points.\n\nAnd direct trade between Russia and the West collapsed following the invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on Russia.\n\nWhat about the implications of geopolitics for trade relations more broadly?\n\nConsider a world divided into three blocs: a U.S. leaning bloc, a China leaning bloc, and a bloc of nonaligned countries.\n\nThe average weighted quarter-on-quarter[1] trade growth between U.S. leaning countries and China leaning countries during 2022Q2 \u2013 2023Q3 was almost 5 percentage points lower than the average quarterly weighted trade growth during 2017Q1 \u2013 2022Q1.\n\nAt the same time, quarterly growth in trade within blocs only saw a 2-percentage point drop.\n\nOn average in the period after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, we see that trade and FDI between blocs declined by roughly 12 and 20 percent more than flows within blocs, respectively.\n\nIt is notable that these patterns are not driven uniquely by the U.S. or China and hold up even when you take these two countries out of the picture.\n\nThis begs a question: Why have we not seen an even bigger impact of de-coupling between geopolitical rivals on global trade?\n\nThis is because some trade and investment are being re-routed through third-party countries, partially offsetting the erosion of direct links between the U.S. and China. Since 2017, greater Chinese presence in a country\u2014measured either through exports or announced greenfield investment\u2014has been associated with increased exports of that country to the U.S.\n\nThe emergence of these \u201cconnector\u201d countries\u2014perhaps most notably Mexico and Vietnam\u2014may have helped cushion the global economic impact of direct trade decoupling between the U.S. and China. But whether it has helped to diversify exposures and increase supply chain resilience remains an open question.\n\nThe path forward will depend on policymakers. They may accept such rerouting of trade and FDI in order to preserve some of the gains of economic integration. Or they may continue to raise barriers for cross-border trade and investment, further breaking both direct and indirect links between politically distant countries.\n\nHow bad could it get?\n\nTo gauge the potential magnitude of fragmentation along geopolitical lines, let\u2019s compare the current trade fragmentation with that of the Cold War period.\n\nTrade between the rival Western and Eastern blocs was significantly depressed during the Cold War, relative to trade within these blocs.\n\nThus far, today\u2019s fragmentation is not significantly different from the initial years of the Cold War. However, compared to the average \u201cbetween-bloc trade shortfall\u201d during the entire Cold War period, fragmentation so far is an order of magnitude smaller.\n\nBut there is still cause for concern. Trade fragmentation is much more costly this time around because unlike the start of the Cold War when goods trade to GDP was 16 percent, now that ratio is 45 percent. Moreover, while back then countries within a bloc were taking off trade restrictions, now we are in an environment of growing protectionism with several countries turning inward.\n\nThe potential role of non-aligned countries in the current trade frictions also makes the situation today different from the Cold War experience. The evidence suggests such countries did not play an important role serving as connectors between rival blocs during the Cold War\u2014likely because they had a much smaller economic footprint and global supply chains were not yet developed. Today, they have greater economic and diplomatic heft and are much more integrated into the global economy. Their role as connectors this time round can help attenuate some of the costs of fragmentation.\n\nHave geopolitical tensions and the shifting patterns of trade and FDI affected the currency composition of cross-border payments and FX reserves?\n\nData on currency use in international trade and finance is sparser and comes with longer lags than trade figures. Even so, we are so far not seeing a significant impact. Despite increased geopolitical risks, the latest data show that the U.S. dollar remains dominant. According to SWIFT, it accounts for over 80 percent of trade finance, likely because much of commodity trade continues to be invoiced and settled in dollars.\n\nIt also accounts for nearly 60 percent of FX reserves despite the gradual diversification of FX reserves away from the dollar and partly into non-traditional reserve currencies such as the Australian dollar, and the Canadian dollar.[2]\n\nGiven the reshaping of trade relations, has the currency composition of trade finance changed during 2022-23?\n\nThe answer is not much for U.S.-leaning countries, but there have been more visible changes for China-leaning countries.\n\nFor the China bloc, the USD share of trade finance payments has declined since early 2022. At the same time, the RMB share has more than doubled, from around 4 percent to 8 percent.\n\nThis is not a Russia only story. In fact, the share of RMB in trade finance for the China bloc would be only slightly lower if Russia were excluded from it. Most RMB denominated trade finance captured in the SWIFT data reflects transactions between China and China leaning countries.\n\nFor China, the share of RMB in all cross-border transactions of Chinese non-bank entities with foreign counterparts was close to zero 15 years ago but has risen to reach around 50 percent in late 2023. In contrast, the USD share has been on a declining trend, falling from around 80 percent in 2010 to 50 percent in 2023.\n\nThe increasing use of the RMB may have been supported by the Cross-Border Interbank Payments System (CIPS)\u2014a system launched by the People\u2019s Bank of China which offers clearing and settlement services for cross-border transactions in RMB.\n\nLooking at global FX reserves, the most notable development during 2022-23 has been an increase of gold purchases by central banks.\n\nGold is generally viewed as politically neutral safe asset, which can be stored at home and be insulated from sanctions or seizure. It can also be an inflation hedge but cannot be easily used in transactions.\n\nThe share of gold in the FX reserves of the China bloc has been rising since 2015\u2014a trend not exclusively driven by China and Russia. Importantly, during the same period, the share of gold in FX reserves of countries in the U.S. bloc has been broadly stable.\n\nThis suggests that gold purchases by some central banks may have been driven by concerns about sanctions risk. This is consistent with a recent IMF study[3] confirming that FX reserve managers tend to increase gold holdings to hedge against economic uncertainty and geopolitical including sanctions risk.\n\nLooking at China, the share of gold in total FX reserves has increased from less than 2 percent in 2015 to 4.3 percent in 2023. During the same period, the value of China\u2019s holdings of U.S. Treasury and Agency bonds relative to FX reserves has declined from 44 percent to about 30 percent. This reflects both net purchases and valuation effects.\n\nThe downward trend holds even if we account for the fact that some of China\u2019s holdings of U.S. bonds may be held in Belgium (Euroclear), as some analysts suggest.[4]\n\nIf fragmentation deepens, what would be the economic cost? And how will those costs be transmitted?\n\nTrade is the main channel through which fragmentation could reshape the global economy. Imposing restrictions on trade would diminish the efficiency gains from specialization, limit economies of scale, and reduce competition. The capacity of trade to incentivize within-industry reallocation and generate productivity gains would be stifled. Less trade would also imply less knowledge diffusion, a key benefit of integration, which could also be reduced by fragmentation of cross-border direct investment. A useful example is Brexit. Because of the extensive interlinkages between Europe and the UK, Brexit is thought to have had a sizable negative effect on the UK economy.\n\nThere would also be costs from financial fragmentation. It would limit capital accumulation\u2014because FDI would be reduced\u2014and affect the allocation of capital, asset prices, and the international payment system. Financial fragmentation could also lead to weaker international risk sharing, resulting in higher macro-financial volatility for individual countries, and higher crisis risks due to idiosyncratic shocks[5]. The global payment system could become fragmented along geopolitical lines with the emergence of new payment platforms with limited or no interoperability. This could lower efficiency, and lead to fragmented standards and regulation.\n\nIn addition, FX reserves could be re-aligned to reflect new economic links and geopolitical risks. A global system with multiple reserve currencies could have several benefits, including a larger pool of safe assets and more opportunities for FX reserve diversification. But the stability of such a system would be at risk without strong policy coordination among all reserve currency issuing countries\u2014including through a network of swap lines. This would not be possible if the world is divided along geopolitical lines.\n\nThe estimates of the economic costs of fragmentation vary widely and are highly uncertain. In a mild scenario with low adjustment costs, losses could be as low as 0.2% of world GDP, while in an extreme trade fragmentation scenario with limited ability of economies to adjust, losses could be as high as 7 percent of global GDP[6]. As for foreign direct investment, fragmentation in a world divided into two blocs centered around the U.S. and China with some countries remaining non-aligned could result in long term losses of around 2 percent of global GDP[7].\n\nSome countries could benefit from fragmentation in its mild forms. But if fragmentation worsens, they could be left with a larger slice of a much smaller pie. In short, everyone could lose.\n\nSome emerging and developing economies could benefit from fragmentation in its mild forms as trade and FDI gets redirected towards them. However, as a group they would be disproportionately negatively impacted by more severe forms of fragmentation. These economies rely more on imports and exports of key products, including commodities, for which it is harder and more costly to find new markets and suppliers.\n\nOur research suggests that low-income countries, on average, could experience 4 times the simulated global economic output loss of other countries in the event of fragmentation of commodity markets into two blocs[8]. Most of the losses would be due to trade restrictions of agricultural commodities, as low-income countries are heavily dependent on agricultural imports to feed their populations, raising concerns about food security in poorer countries.\n\nFurthermore, emerging markets and developing economies are heavily dependent on FDI from advanced economies, the main source of global investment. They would also be left without positive spillovers from FDI to local firms in the case of friend-shoring or reshoring, when FDI is relocated to \u201cfriendly\u201d countries in the other bloc or home.\n\nFragmentation would also inhibit our efforts to address other global challenges that demand international cooperation. The breadth of these challenges\u2014from climate change to AI\u2014is immense.\n\nRecent IMF analysis shows that fragmentation of trade in minerals critical for the green transition\u2014such as copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium\u2014would make the energy transition more costly. Because these minerals are geographically concentrated and not easily substituted, disrupting their trade could lead to sharp swings in their prices, suppressing investment in renewables and EV production.\n\nSo, what can we do to prevent this? The ideal solution would be to preserve and strengthen the multilateral rules-based global trading system and the international monetary system.\n\nStrengthening the trading system would require restoring a fully functioning WTO dispute settlement mechanism. It will also require making more progress on dealing with subsidies and national security trade restrictions and developing international rules and norms on the appropriate use and design of industrial polices.\n\nTo strengthen the international monetary system, concerted efforts are needed to prevent fragmentation of the global payment system and related standards and regulations. We also need to ensure a well-resourced and efficient global financial safety net, improve measurement and monitoring of cross-border crypto flows, and maintain global dialogue on debt restructuring.\n\nBut given where we are today, the ideal may be difficult to achieve. Therefore, we need pragmatic steps to rebuild trust.\n\nThe first step is to keep open the lines of communication and stay engaged. Dialogue between the U.S. and China\u2014which we are now seeing\u2014can help prevent the worst outcomes from occurring.\n\nNon-aligned countries can also play a bigger role\u2014using their economic and diplomatic heft to keep the world integrated.\n\nThe second pragmatic step is to work together on areas of common interest. Take climate, for example. Over 70 countries have come together through the WTO\u2019s Trade and Environmental Stability Structured Discussions to identify opportunities to promote the trade of renewable energy goods and services.\n\nWe also see progress in services and digital trade. Policy restrictions are high in these fast-growing areas of the global economy. But recognizing this, 90 countries representing more than 90 percent of global trade are working together toward common digital trade rules.\n\nAnd 71 members came together around a WTO plurilateral agreement on Services Domestic Regulation that aims to promote more transparent, predictable, and efficient regulatory frameworks and is expected to reduce services trade costs by USD 127 billion.\n\nIn addition, the G20 is working on interlinking cross-border payment systems, aiming to improve efficiency and reduce transaction costs.\n\nThe third step is to limit harmful unilateral policy actions\u2014including industrial policies. While it is appropriate to try to correct market failures through policy interventions, it must be carefully handled. Politically, industrial policies may be hard to limit or roll back given their concentrated benefits and diffused costs. History is replete with cautionary tales of policy mistakes, high fiscal costs & negative spillovers to other countries. Internationally, such policies have led to retaliation, which would deepen fragmentation.\n\nAdhering to existing legal frameworks is also critical for maintaining trust between countries and in the international monetary system.\n\nFor example, many countries are following closely the ongoing discussion about potential use of Russian state assets, including reserves of the Bank of Russia, to support Ukraine. While this is for relevant courts and jurisdictions to determine, for the IMF, it is important that any action has sufficient legal underpinnings and does not undermine the functioning of the international monetary system.\n\nWhile rebuilding trust is difficult and may take time, it is critical to avoid the worst outcomes in a rapidly fragmenting world. It is well worth it to preserve some of the enormous gains from economic integration that have made the world more prosperous and more secure.\n\n[1] See Gopinath at al \u201cChanging Global Linkages: A New Cold War?\u201d, IMF Working Paper No. 2024/076 (link)\n\n[2] See Arslanalp et al. \u201cThe Stealth Erosion of Dollar Dominance: Active Diversifiers and the Rise of Nontraditional Reserve Currencies\u201d IMF Working Paper, No. 2022/058 (link)\n\n[3] Arslanalp et al \u201cGold as International Reserves: A Barbarous Relic No More?\u201d, IMF Working Paper No. 2023/014 (link) analyze a panel of 144 economies over the period 1980-2021.\n\n[4] Analysts believe that part of the US securities holdings attributed to Belgium may belong to other countries, such as China or Saudi Arabia (see Bertaut and Judson (2014), Sester (2016)).\n\n[5] See GFSR April 2023 \u201cSafeguarding Financial Stability Amid High Inflation and Geopolitical Risks\u201d (link)\n\n[6] See IMF Staff Discussion Note, \u201cGeoeconomic Fragmentation and the Future of Multilateralism\u201d, January 2023 (link)\n\n[7] See WEO April 2023, Chapter 4 \u201cGeoeconomic Fragmentation and Foreign Direct Investment\u201d (link)\n\n[8] See WEO October 2023, Chapter 3 \u201cFragmentation and Commodity Markets: Vulnerabilities and Risks\u201d (link)",

      "title": "World Leaders On Speed-Dial: How Elon Musk Is Causing Geopolitical Tremors",
      "content": "It isn't unthinkable that the world's richest person can pull more than just a few strings with top politicians, but Elon Musk seems to be investing himself in the political world with such intensity that analysts now wonder if there is a larger plan.\n\nLast week Elon Musk created history by breaking his own previous record and becoming the first person to have a net worth of more than 400 billion dollars. In just six days, he has added nearly another 100 billion ($86 billion) and is knocking on the 500-billion-dollar mark. In the last one year, Musk has added $257 billion to his net worth - $7 billion more than the entire net worth of Jeff Bezos - the second-most richest person globally.\n\nImage and Data Credit: Bloomberg\n\nBut Musk is not just riding the high wave when it comes to business, he is now doing the same in geopolitics. Having being included in the Trump Administration 2.0, Elon Musk finds himself immersed in the world of politics. Though he was deeply involved with Donald Trump's campaign and is partially credited for the latter's win in the US elections, he now seems to be backing - or rather, influencing - leaders from beyond the United States.\n\nUS DONE, MUSK SETS EYES ON UK\n\nFrom supporting one firebrand leader to now backing another one - this time in the UK - Elon Musk has held extensive talks with anti-immigration hardliner Nigel Farage. The discussions between the two were largely focused on Musk funding Farage's hard-right party 'Reform UK'.\n\nElon Musk, who now freely uses Donald Trump's Florida resort estate-cum-residence, Mar-a-Lago, as his political office, invited Nigel Farage for a meeting earlier this week.\n\nWriting about it in British daily The Telegraph, Mr Farage confirmed that \"the issue of money was discussed\", though the two could not agree on the amount in question by the end of that meeting. \"There will be ongoing negotiations on that score,\" Mr Farage added.\n\nSharing details about the meeting, that will most certainly raise eyebrows in the UK's two main political party offices - The Labour Party, now in government and the Conservative Party, currently the opposition - Mr Farage mentioned about Elon Musk's disdain for both parties. He stated that Musk \"described the Labour and Conservative parties as the uniparty, and left us (Reform Party) in no doubt that he is right behind us.\"\n\nIn his article Mr Farage also mentioned that he aims to learn from Elon Musk's cash incentives for people to be encouraged to vote - a strategy that worked for Donald Trump's Republican party during the US elections. Mr Farage stated that \"I have come home with copious notes on how they increased turnout, voter registration, and so much more, and all of this I intend to implement as part of the professionalisation of our party.\"\n\nElon Musk is reportedly considering an initial donation of $100 million to Nigel Farage's Reform Party. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Farage said, \"He wants to help us, he's not opposed to the idea of giving us money provided we can do it legally through UK companies.\"\n\nIt will be a steep ask for Mr Farage's party to even think of winning a general election in the UK. In the most recent elections held this year, the Reform Party won just five seats in the 650-seat UK Parliament. However, it scores impressively in terms of vote share, accounting for 14 per cent of all the votes cast. Mr Farage hopes that with Musk's support - moral and financial - his party might just do the unthinkable.\n\nConcluding his article, Mr Farage wrote, \"It is heartening to listen to Elon speak about UK politics with such deep care. He regards the mother country of the English-speaking world as being in very deep trouble.\"\n\nAfter their meeting, Mr Farage wrote on Musk's social media platform X that \"\"Britain needs reform\", to which Elon Musk promptly replied \"Absolutely\".\n\nAbsolutely \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 17, 2024\n\nELON MUSK'S CALL WITH UKRAINE'S ZELENSKY\n\nLast month Elon Musk was with Donald Trump at the President-elect's residence and luxury resort Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida when Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on the phone.\n\nDuring the phone call, Donald Trump reportedly handed the phone over to Elon Musk and supposedly asked the SpaceX founder to join the call with President Zelensky.\n\nElon Musk then reassured President Zelensky that he will continue to help Ukraine via his Starlink satellite constellation. Since the Russian invasion in 2022, Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system has provided Ukraine with significant frontline advantage by allowing its armed forces to share real-time drone coordinates, data and footage between units. It also gave Ukraine's military communications support in areas where mobile phone networks were destroyed.\n\nFRIENDSHIP WITH ARGENTINA'S JAVIER MILEI\n\nArgentinian President Javier Milei was reportedly one of the few world leaders to have been invited for Donald Trump's swearing-in ceremony on January 20, 2025 - an invite he has reportedly accepted. Elon Musk has been a very strong supporter of President Milei.\n\nIn fact, as per a report in the New York Times, in a video uploaded on social media platform X by Elon Musk himself, the tech billionaire claimed that watching President Milei's speech was \"better than having sex\".\n\nElon Musk had even met President Milei when news of his electoral victory was confirmed. In a post on X before that meeting, Musk had written \"Prosperity is ahead for Argentina\".\n\nIt must be noted that Argentina has large deposits of Lithium, which is crucial for Elon Musk's EV company Tesla.\n\nAccording to a report by CNN, Elon Musk is in talks with at least a dozen other world leaders - for geopolitical reasons as well as for business.\n\nOnly time will unravel whether Elon Musk's political outreach is restricted to just pulling a few strings, or will it result in him holding on to the very reins that might restructure global politics.\n\n",

      "content": "Mangaluru: A session on the topic \u2018 Himalayan Geopolitics ' held as part of the seventh edition of the Mangaluru Literature Festival delved into the complex dynamics shaping the geopolitical landscape of the Himalayan region, featuring a diverse panel of experts.Dr Claude Arpi, a renowned expert on Indo-China and Tibet relations, shared his personal journey and the evolution of his interest in Himalayan geopolitics. A dental surgeon from France, Dr Arpi's first visit to India in 1972 marked the beginning of his deep connection with the region. He expressed concern over the rapid development in the region, emphasising the need to balance growth with environmental preservation to maintain the natural and spiritual essence of the Himalayas.The discussion also touched on territorial disputes and military tensions between India and China. Dr Arpi discussed the events of May 2020, when Chinese forces attempted to advance into disputed areas in Ladakh, leading to tense standoffs. Despite China's infrastructure advantage, he expressed confidence in India's defence capabilities, particularly along the LAC, and reassured that a repeat of the 2020 incursions was unlikely.Dilip Sinha, a former senior diplomat with expertise in critical international relations, shared insights from his book, \u2018The Imperial Games in Tibet', which explores the history of Himalayan geopolitics. Sinha argued that China's territorial claims over Tibet, including Arunachal Pradesh, lacked historical legitimacy, as Tibet was only temporarily colonised during the Qing Dynasty.Jangchup Choeden, deputy general secretary of the International Buddhist Confederation, introduced the cultural and religious dimensions of Himalayan geopolitics, emphasising Buddhism's significant role in shaping the region's identity. He discussed the ongoing geopolitical narratives surrounding Tibetan Buddhism, particularly China's attempt to reshape the religion with Chinese characteristics, while India continues to uphold Buddhism's roots.The session concluded with a key message that India must deepen its understanding of Tibet's history and geopolitical importance, leveraging its cultural and spiritual heritage to navigate the complex dynamics of the region and counter China's growing influence.",

These developments have underscored that the security of the nation can neither be outsourced nor be dependent on the largesse of others,\u201d General Pande said addressing the national leadership conclave of All India Management Association.\n\nAlso read | A world in disarray, a concern about the future\n\nIn the context of capability development, if we are import-dependent for critical technologies on countries that possess them, we must be very clear that we will always remain one technology cycle behind, General Pande said. \u201cWeapons manufacturing, aerospace, shipbuilding and electronics are some of the sectors where we must create our own equivalent to Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin or Raytheon Technologies, to name a few.\u201d\n\nThe Army\u2019s transformation roadmap entailed five pillars \u2013 force restructuring and optimisation; modernisation and technology infusion; improving our systems, processes and functions; human resource management; and promoting jointness and integration with the sister services, the Army Chief said. \u201cThe unprecedented trends in the geostrategic landscape, the limitless potential of disruptive technologies, the transforming character of modern wars and the profound changes in the socio-economic domain, are the four key drivers of Army\u2019s transformation efforts,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn this regard, to achieve self-reliance, he said linkages amongst academia, research and development establishments, industry, and users or the Services are critical for this ecosystem. Stating that Indian defence industry on its part is rising up to the challenge, General Pande said there are 340 indigenous defence industries working towards fructification of 230 contracts by 2025, that entail an outlay of \u20b92.5 lakh crore.\n\nSimilarly, he said Army\u2019s ammunition inventory comprises 175 variants of different calibre and type, of which 134 ammunition variants have already been indigenised through efforts of the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) and defence public sector units.",
