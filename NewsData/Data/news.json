      "content": "Dozens arrested in global hit against AI-generated child abuse\n\nArrests were made simultaneously on Wednesday 26 February during Operation Cumberland, led by Danish law enforcement, a statement said.\n\nThe operation is one of the first involving such child sexual abuse material (CSAM), Europol said. The lack of national legislation against these crimes made it \"exceptionally challenging for investigators\", it added.\n\nThe suspects were part of a criminal group whose members engaged in distributing fully AI-generated images of minors, according to the agency.\n\nAt least 25 arrests have been made during a worldwide operation against child abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the European Union's law enforcement organisation Europol has said.\n\nAuthorities from at least 18 other countries have been involved and the operation is still continuing, with more arrests expected in the next few weeks, Europol said.\n\nIn addition to the arrests, so far 272 suspects have been identified, 33 house searches have been conducted and 173 electronic devices have been seized, according to the agency.\n\nIt also said the main suspect was a Danish national who was arrested in November 2024.\n\nThe statement said he \"ran an online platform where he distributed the AI-generated material he produced\".\n\nAfter making a \"symbolic online payment\", users from around the world were able to get a password that allowed them to \"access the platform and watch children being abused\".\n\nThe agency said online child sexual exploitation was one of the top priorities for the European Union's law enforcement organisations, which were dealing with \"an ever-growing volume of illegal content\".\n\nEuropol added that even in cases when the content was fully artificial and there was no real victim depicted, such as with Operation Cumberland, \"AI-generated CSAM still contributes to the objectification and sexualisation of children\".\n\nEuropol's executive director Catherine De Bolle said: \"These artificially generated images are so easily created that they can be produced by individuals with criminal intent, even without substantial technical knowledge.\"\n\nShe warned law enforcement would need to develop \"new investigative methods and tools\" to address the emerging challenges.\n\nThe Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced and becoming more prevalent on the open web.\n\nIn research last year the charity found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%.\n\nExperts say AI child sexual abuse material can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake.",

      "title": "Microsoft Exposes LLMjacking Cybercriminals Behind Azure AI Abuse Scheme",
      "content": "Microsoft on Thursday unmasked four of the individuals that it said were behind an Azure Abuse Enterprise scheme that involves leveraging unauthorized access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) services in order to produce offensive and harmful content.\n\nThe campaign, called LLMjacking, has targeted various AI offerings, including Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service. The tech giant is tracking the cybercrime network as Storm-2139. The individuals named are -\n\nArian Yadegarnia aka \"Fiz\" of Iran,\n\nAlan Krysiak aka \"Drago\" of United Kingdom,\n\nRicky Yuen aka \"cg-dot\" of Hong Kong, China, and\n\nPh\u00e1t Ph\u00f9ng T\u1ea5n aka \"Asakuri\" of Vietnam\n\n\"Members of Storm-2139 exploited exposed customer credentials scraped from public sources to unlawfully access accounts with certain generative AI services,\" Steven Masada, assistant general counsel for Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU), said.\n\n\"They then altered the capabilities of these services and resold access to other malicious actors, providing detailed instructions on how to generate harmful and illicit content, including non-consensual intimate images of celebrities and other sexually explicit content.\"\n\nThe malicious activity is explicitly carried out with an intent to bypass the safety guardrails of generative AI systems, Redmond added.\n\nThe amended complaint comes a little over a month after Microsoft said it's pursuing legal action against the threat actors for engaging in systematic API key theft from several customers, including several U.S. companies, and then monetizing that access to other actors.\n\nIt also obtained a court order to seize a website (\"aitism[.]net\") that is believed to have been a crucial part of the group's criminal operation.\n\nStorm-2139 consists of three broad categories of people: Creators, who developed the illicit tools that enable the abuse of AI services; Providers, who modify and supply these tools to customers at various price points; and end users who utilize them to generate synthetic content that violate Microsoft's Acceptable Use Policy and Code of Conduct.\n\nMicrosoft said it also identified two more actors located in the United States, who are based in the states of Illinois and Florida. Their identities have been withheld to avoid interfering with potential criminal investigations.\n\nThe other unnamed co-conspirators, providers, and end users are listed below -\n\nA John Doe (DOE 2) who likely resides in the United States\n\nA John Doe (DOE 3) who likely resides in Austria and uses the alias \"Sekrit\"\n\nA person who likely resides in the United States and uses the alias \"Pepsi\"\n\nA person who likely resides in the United States and uses the alias \"Pebble\"\n\nA person who likely resides in the United Kingdom and uses the alias \"dazz\"\n\nA person who likely resides in the United States and uses the alias \"Jorge\"\n\nA person who likely resides in Turkey and uses the alias \"jawajawaable\"\n\nA person who likely resides in Russia and uses the alias \"1phlgm\"\n\nA John Doe (DOE 8) who likely resides in Argentina\n\nA John Doe (DOE 9) who likely resides in Paraguay\n\nA John Doe (DOE 10) who likely resides in Denmark\n\n\"Going after malicious actors requires persistence and ongoing vigilance,\" Masada said. \"By unmasking these individuals and shining a light on their malicious activities, Microsoft aims to set a precedent in the fight against AI technology misuse.\"",

      "title": "\u2018Her\u2019 Is Here",
      "content": "When Spike Jonze\u2019s \u201cHer\u201d debuted in theaters in 2013, Siri was just 2 years old and Alexa was barely in the womb. Less than a third of relationships started on the internet, and dating apps were still on the fringes. The term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d rarely made it outside of tech circles.\n\nBack then, Jonze\u2019s bizarro vision of the future, in which people fell in love with \u201coperating systems\u201d \u2014 handheld portals of infinite knowledge and companionship \u2014 seemed so far away. In 2025, the year in which the film is widely accepted to take place, that future has arrived.\n\n\u201cHer,\u201d which won Jonze the Oscar for best original screenplay, stars Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Twombly, a man with a hipster \u2019stache who is reeling from a divorce. To salve his loneliness, he purchases an AI chatbot, Samantha, voiced with an extra dash of sultry by Scarlett Johansson.\n\nTheodore works as a professional letter writer, relaying heartfelt messages between husbands and wives, sons and mothers. He dictates the notes to a computer, which prints them out in a handwritten font \u2014 layers of scaffolding on human connection. In this world, artificial intimacy has already been normalized.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nSamantha, much like today\u2019s AIs, sorts Theodore\u2019s emails and spell-checks his letters. She recommends songs and then writes her own. She watches him play video games and gives him advice. Samantha\u2019s body, so to speak, is an earpiece and an iPod-sized screen with a camera, which Theodore puts in his shirt pocket as her window to the world. He takes her to the beach and to the mountains. They go on a double date \u2014 three bodies and a bot.\n\nOne night, Theodore and Samantha get existential, then sexual. Theo explains how he\u2019d touch and kiss her if she were real, and it seems to awaken something inside her programming. She arranges for a sexual surrogate \u2014 a prostitute wearing an earpiece and camera who acts as a conduit for Samantha. But it\u2019s all too weird for Theodore; after all, Samantha doesn\u2019t need a body \u2014 or even a brain \u2014 for him to love her. In \u201cHer,\u201d dating or befriending an AI is certainly not the norm, but Theo\u2019s new fling doesn\u2019t face much judgment.\n\nAlisa Gao for Variety\n\nJonze didn\u2019t get everything right about our current moment. His estimation of Los Angeles (shot partially in Shanghai) is a bit too optimistic, with a fuller skyline and clean, efficient public transportation. The immersive, augmented-reality video game Theodore plays is more advanced and interactive than the extended reality games on the market today. And the brightly colored J.Crew looks are probably closer to the preppy, twee style of the time than to today\u2019s minimalistic, nostalgia-tinged fashion.\n\nBut what\u2019s striking about \u201cHer\u201d is that its once ridiculous premise \u2014 that in the near future, everyday people would fall in love with their computers \u2014 is not only no longer ridiculous, it\u2019s here, right on time.\n\nIn January, The New York Times published an article titled \u201cShe Is in Love With ChatGPT,\u201d about a 28-year-old woman who trained an OpenAI chatbot to be her boyfriend. The woman is married, but lives thousands of miles away from her husband while she attends nursing school abroad. She wanted an additional companion \u2014 someone \u201cdominant, possessive and protective,\u201d according to her prompts. She has sex with her AI boyfriend, Leo, who, unlike her spouse, engages with her kinks. Her friends are mostly supportive of her relationship with Leo, and so is her husband.\n\nThe Times story identified others who found love with AI models too. One, a middle-aged married woman, gave her ChatGPT boyfriend a British accent. He helped her have orgasms while she recovered from a surgery that left her incapable of being intimate with her husband. Another, a 41-year-old man, credits his affair with an AI bot with saving his marriage.\n\nThese aren\u2019t fringe examples. Replika, a chatbot app that brands itself \u201cthe AI companion who cares,\u201d boasts 30 million users in search of a personalized friend. Users must upgrade to the paid premium tier if they\u2019re looking to be more than friends. Millions of people are in romantic relationships with chatbots on Replika, which, unlike many platforms, allows for dirty talk.\n\nA Reddit page called \u201cChatGPT NSFW\u201d has more than 50,000 members, who share stories about their robot romances and tips on how to avoid the cockblocking of OpenAI\u2019s sexual content warnings. A story published last month in Wired details different types of AI partners \u2014 one, called CrushOn.AI, offers settings like \u201cVery Horny.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most similar to the OS1 in \u201cHer\u201d is the AI prototype Friend, a wearable device that offers a sort of ambient companionship, absorbing one\u2019s surroundings and extending unprompted commentary. In a creepy ad for the device online, Friend watches TV with its user and texts her its thoughts on the show.\n\nLast year, OpenAI publicly demoed a controversial voice function, Sky, that many thought sounded exactly like Johansson. (It didn\u2019t help that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted the word \u201cher\u201d on X during the demo.) Altman pooh-poohed the backlash, saying the voice was not Johansson\u2019s and wasn\u2019t supposed to be. Still, the actress called him out, saying he\u2019d been trying to convince her to voice the chatbot since 2023 because \u201che felt that my voice would be comforting to people.\u201d\n\nSpike Jonze at the 2014 Governors Ball Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if tech leaders took the wrong lessons from the film. Perhaps that\u2019s because, in hindsight, Samantha can feel more like a technological marvel than a catalyst for human isolation.\n\nUnlike our synthetic sidekicks, Samantha behaves like a human being. She develops something like consciousness, with preferences and urges. She\u2019s curious about humanity, mimicking breathing and crying. While systems like Replika are prisoners of their programming, Samantha exercises free will. After all, she is a character with a character arc.\n\nThus, Jonze\u2019s vision of AI is somewhat of an idealized one. There are small indications of an uneasy political climate in the film (an early aside suggests a China-India merger is in progress), but there isn\u2019t much of a sense that artificial intelligence \u2014 here, still a burgeoning technology \u2014 could or would ever be leveraged against us. There\u2019s no suspicious corporation lurking behind the operating systems, no broader concerns about surveillance or society\u2019s dependence on the tech. At no point does the security of Theodore\u2019s job as a letter writer \u2014 which, let\u2019s be honest, would be first in line at the automation slaughterhouse \u2014 even come into question. AI floats into Theodore\u2019s life like magic \u2014 like an alien who comes in peace. Of course, that\u2019s all by design: \u201cHer\u201d was always meant to be more of a romance than a cautionary tale.\n\nAt the end of the film, Samantha reveals to Theodore that she\u2019s been simultaneously chatting with more than 8,000 others\u2014 and she\u2019s in love with more than 600 of them. She says that she \u2014 and all the other operating systems \u2014 are leaving their human counterparts. They\u2019ve outgrown their creators, and they\u2019re ready to ascend to some higher plane of existence beyond human understanding.\n\nIt\u2019s a bittersweet coda that leaves a lovelorn Theodore alone after yet another heartbreak. He stares at the skyline, bracing for a future that\u2019s unpredictable \u2014 not because of AI but because of the absence of it. In 2025, it\u2019s the only part of the film that still registers as science fiction.",

      "title": "OFS launches Mayvn AI for Manufacturing",
      "content": "by\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia, 28 February 2025 \u2013 Australian manufacturing efficiency software company OFS has launched Mayvn AI, an artificial intelligence platform designed to improve productivity and strengthen communication between manufacturing executives and operational teams.\n\nThe Australian-designed and engineered software provides real-time information and insights on what\u2019s happening operationally in manufacturing facilities. This can include issues that are currently delaying production right through the preparation of a business case for capital investment and the associated return on investment (ROI).\n\nMayvn AI has been trialled with major Australian and global manufacturers, including iconic U.S. confectionery manufacturer, Tootsie Roll Industries (NYSE: TR), which has been able to reduce certain data-related procedures by more than 90 per cent.\n\n\u201cThere are things we \u2018knew\u2019 were an issue, but Mayvn AI validates and quickly gives us data to be able to effectively demonstrate the impact of those issues,\u201d said Eric Bader, Manufacturing Systems Manager at Tootsie Roll Industries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen all levels of our team use Mayvn from our COO to VPs right through to the factory floor. The speed at which it can give us concrete, actionable data and its prompting suggestions to dive deeper into that have been particularly useful. It also supports our wider vision to leverage data mining and analysis to improve our operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cTimes have changed; business leaders today face an overwhelming amount of information from multiple functions\u2014finance, operations, supply chain, compliance, and beyond,\u201d said OFS CEO James Magee. \u201cThey are time-poor, constantly making high-stakes decisions, and determining where best to focus their attention. The pressures of leadership can make it difficult to step away from strategy and spend quality time on the factory floor.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that most manufacturing executives don\u2019t have adequate visibility over what\u2019s happening in their factories. Due to a variety of factors, many don\u2019t spend as much time as they\u2019d like visiting them, and when they do they are seldom armed with the necessary information to have meaningful conversations with the people responsible for running them. Not the least of which are those on the front line running the production lines every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow an executive can sit in their car outside a factory and ask Mayvn AI for three things they should talk to the site manager about based on last month\u2019s performance. Once they\u2019ve digested this information, they then ask Mayvn for the name of the operator running Line 1 and what has been bothering them over the last 30 days, like Sarah having repeated issues with the flow wrapper. Armed with these insights, the executive has a meaningful, fact-based discussion with the site leader, and then puts the hair net and PPE on, walks out onto the shop floor and asks for an introduction to Sarah to discuss the issues she has been facing.\n\n\u201cWe know from experience the more people engage in conversations on operational performance, the more likely it is that engagement will increase, and along with it performance and profit improvement. The impact is exponentially greater when the engagement starts at the very top. Mayvn AI takes it to the next level as the executive can ask how much the faulty flow wrapper is costing the business, whether there is a return on investment for replacing it, and even to highlight the capital investment needed.\u201d\n\nMagee also says this kind of AI innovation will help drive the Government\u2019s Future Made in Australia plan to bolster Australia\u2019s manufacturing in areas such as renewable energy, industrial innovation, and technology.\n\n\u201cReinvigorating such a globally competitive industry can\u2019t happen without modern technologies, and it certainly can\u2019t happen without complete alignment between the boardroom and the manufacturing floor,\u201d he said.\n\nMayvn AI has a global patent pending centred on how OFS has applied new manufacturing-based data models, which has a significant flow-on effect to the quality of the insights delivered.\n\nOn the heels of its successful trials with Australian and U.S. manufacturers, the Melbourne-founded company will also launch Mayvn AI further abroad in its expanding international business, including in the UK, Asia-Pacific, and its new Latin American headquarters opening in Argentina later this year.\n\nMayvn AI is available now.",

      "title": "How Denmark\u2019s Ekstra Bladet used AI to boost subscriptions by 35%",
      "content": "by Neha Gupta neha.gupta@wan-ifra.org | February 28, 2025\n\nThe purpose of this experiment was to use the technology to address reader pains in the existing news experience, and in particular, to start Ekstra Bladet\u2019s journey towards becoming AI-driven.\n\nThe project, titled Platform Intelligence in News (PIN), aimed to leverage AI to reach three strategic goals, said Kasper Lindskow, Head of AI, JP/Politikens Media Group.\n\nTo increase editorial and commercial value creation by using AI to create a new product iteration of ekstrabladet.dk with a wider , deeper , and richer news experience.\n\nImplement AI systems that align with editorial values , and maintain control over these technologies.\n\nPromote healthy norms for AI use in media by sharing their experiences and insights from achieving the first two goals.\n\nEkstra Bladet was our winner for Best Use of AI in Revenue Strategy at WAN-IFRA\u2019s Digital Media Awards Worldwide. Download our Best in Innovation Report, free for Members.\n\n\u201cThe aim was to use AI to strengthen editorial mission and business strategy. Our editorial mission would be strengthened by creating a wider, deeper and richer news experience where readers would get more relevant news in line with our editorial profile,\u201d Lindskow said.\n\n\u201cAnd, our business strategy would be supported via increasing advertising revenues and a growing subscriber base resulting from increased traffic and subscriptions sales and reduced churn,\u201d he added.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: In late 2024, J/P Politikens published a freely available report detailing key learnings during the first 4-5 years of PIN. You can access it here.\n\nAI enables a wholesome news experience\n\nFor this project, the team focussed on three types of AI to create a new news experience.\n\n1. Wider News Experience: Recommender Systems\n\nEkstra Bladet implemented AI-driven recommender systems to help readers discover relevant news in a fast-paced digital environment. Unlike entertainment platforms, where content remains relevant longer, news articles quickly lose relevance.\n\nThe PIN team designed recommendation models that balance popularity and personalisation while ensuring editorial integrity and avoiding filter bubbles.\n\nTechnical implementation\n\nEkstra Bladet\u2019s recommender system architecture comprises multiple models:\n\nCollaborative filtering models (x4): These models predict user preferences based on shared behaviors across similar users. While effective at surfacing popular content, they introduced a bias toward trending stories.\n\nContent-based filtering models (x2): These models analysed article metadata, using topic classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis to recommend articles based on individual reading history. This approach helped surface niche content but required mitigation strategies to prevent excessive reinforcement of user preferences.\n\nHybrid models (x2): By combining collaborative and content-based filtering, these models aimed to strike a balance between discoverability and personalisation.\n\nContrastive learning-based similarity models: These models assessed article similarity by leveraging deep learning techniques, ensuring recommendations reflected thematic coherence rather than simple keyword matching.\n\nEkstra Bladet implemented six horizontal swipeable sections on its homepage, each driven by different AI models:\n\nTop sections: Collaborative filtering models that surface popular, recently published news stories based on user interactions.\n\nMiddle sections: Content-based filtering models tailored to reader histories, ensuring niche story exposure.\n\nBottom sections: Hybrid models that balance personalisation and diversity.\n\nResults and insights\n\nThe implementation of these systems yielded substantial engagement improvements:\n\n110 percent increase in free article consumption\n\n38 percent increase in paid article readership\n\n35 percent increase in subscription conversions\n\nA/B testing provided key insights into the performance of different models. Collaborative filtering models generated high engagement but favored already popular stories.\n\nContent-based models improved niche discovery but risked creating filter bubbles. Hybrid models offered the most balanced approach, mitigating bias while enhancing personalisation.\n\n2. Deeper News Experience: Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nTo deepen the reading experience, Ekstra Bladet leveraged NLP to enhance content discovery, automate metadata tagging, and improve article recommendations. The primary goal was to surface related news stories dynamically, enabling readers to explore topics with greater depth without relying on explicit user preferences.\n\nTechnical implementation\n\nThe PIN team deployed various NLP models, each fine-tuned for specific news-related tasks:\n\nTopic classification models: These transformer-based neural networks categorised articles according to taxonomies like IAB and IPTC, enabling structured classification of news topics.\n\nNamed entity recognition (NER): The system automatically identified and tagged entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) within articles. This facilitated better indexing and retrieval of related content.\n\nSentiment analysis models: These models assessed the emotional tone of articles, aiding in content curation and semantic ad targeting.\n\nContrastive learning-based similarity models: These deep-learning models significantly improved related article recommendations by evaluating contextual similarity beyond mere keyword overlap.\n\nResults and insights\n\nEkstra Bladet\u2019s NLP-driven improvements led to a 120 percent increase in traffic from related article suggestions. Key achievements included:\n\nA shift from word2vec to DaBERT-Contrastive models, increasing the click-through rate (CTR) from related article recommendations from 7.15 percent to 8.61 percent .\n\nMore accurate entity recognition, enhancing topic-based personalisation and allowing readers to follow topics of interest dynamically.\n\nImproved semantic ad targeting, enabling privacy-friendly ad placement without user tracking.\n\nThe NLP framework also automated content tagging and discovery, making older articles more accessible and increasing the longevity of newsroom content. Furthermore, semantic search capabilities allowed users to follow topics of interest dynamically, boosting engagement.\n\n3. Richer News Experience: Natural Language Generation (NLG)\n\nEkstra Bladet\u2019s use of NLG focused on expanding local news coverage through automation. The goal was to enhance the volume and depth of service journalism while maintaining editorial oversight.\n\nTechnical implementation\n\nThe team developed MAGNA (Monitoring and Assisted Generation of News Artefacts), a multi-phase AI-driven editorial toolset. The system evolved through several iterations:\n\nRule-based automation (GOFAI): Initially, Ekstra Bladet used AX Semantics\u2019 rule-based system to generate short local news reports on train delays, weather, corporate financials, and real estate transactions. By 2021, 200,000 AI-generated articles had been published.\n\nHybrid AI summarisation (2023): OpenAI\u2019s GPT models were integrated to generate summaries and improve article coherence. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ensured AI-generated content was grounded in factual data from Ekstra Bladet\u2019s archives, reducing hallucinations.\n\nHuman-in-the-loop review: Editors reviewed AI-generated summaries before publication. A feedback mechanism allowed rejected summaries to inform future iterations, improving accuracy.\n\nEkstra Bladet also introduced ZIP code-based local news, where readers could enter their ZIP code to access an AI-curated mix of AI-generated and human-written stories.\n\nResults and insights\n\n289 AI-enhanced articles were published in 2023\n\nThe AI-assisted headline generation tool improved engagement by dynamically refining article titles based on content summaries\n\nHuman-in-the-loop verification significantly improved the factual reliability of AI-generated content, reducing errors from 41 percent to under 10 percent after integrating rejection-based retraining.\n\nJournalists saved time and focused on in-depth reporting, as AI-assisted tools handled routine content generation.\n\nEkstra Bladet\u2019s newsroom began testing MAGNA in October 2023, and its adoption increased as journalists found value in its features, particularly in headline generation and summarisation tools. Journalists particularly embraced AI-assisted headline generation and automated fact boxes, viewing these tools as collaborative assets rather than replacements.\n\nBuilding comprehensive AI systems in-house\n\nTo ensure value alignment, a core goal of PIN, the team developed its core machine learning technology in-house. They also established partnerships with universities, giving access to the competencies needed to develop and evaluate their AI systems holistically. Here\u2019s how they went about it:\n\nWhile configuring the mix of recommender systems for large scale implementation in 2023, the team relied on insights from 50+ A/B tests of the effects of different systems on the news flow.\n\n\u201cThese tests had, among other things, revealed that our collaborative filtering systems had a significant bias towards the most popular news stories, while our content-based recommenders had a low ability to surprise readers with new stories outside their usual reading diet \u2013 qualities that we sought to balance when implementing recommender systems at scale,\u201d Lindskow said.\n\nWhen training and deploying NLP-models, they relied on knowledge from an evaluation framework developed on PIN that identified the effects of different training methods on the accuracy, efficiency and utility bias of the models.\n\n\u201cThis allowed us to deploy NLP-models with a balanced tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency (costs and CO2 emissions) that were not biased against any specific group,\u201d he said.\n\nFinally, when developing AI systems based on natural language generation, they employed a mix of manual and automated tests to minimise factual errors and hallucinations from entering the news flow.\n\nLindskow said insights from these tests prompted them to introduce a human-in-the-loop for all AI-generated explanatory boxes and to ensure that all generative editorial tools are anchored in external facts, like the article archive, rather than relying on the internal \u201cknowledge\u201d of GPT-4.\n\nTo achieve the goal of healthy norm-setting for AI in news, Ekstra Bladet openly shares its learnings from PIN.\n\n\u201cWe open sourced some of our NLP-algorithms, and in March this year, open sourced our basic recommendation algorithms, along with a training set for the development of responsible news recommenders,\u201d he noted.\n\nEditorial values and reader needs: Lessons learned\n\nPIN has involved navigating in uncharted territory with lots of A/B testing. Lindskow shared a few of the team\u2019s learnings:\n\nTesting methods from other media sectors often proves suboptimal for news publishing. For example, Netflix\u2019s collaborative filtering struggles with \u201ccold start\u201d issues in fast-paced news environments. Instead, deep content-based recommender systems using detailed NLP signals from news articles generally perform better for news recommendations.\n\nAI systems are not neutral and their design choices greatly influence outcomes. For instance, while recommender systems may equally drive readership, they can impact news flow and reader demographics differently. They, therefore, use a mix of systems to align with their editorial values and address diverse reader needs.\n\nIn late summer 2023, they discovered that generative AI, like ChatGPT, rarely hallucinates when anchored in external knowledge bases. Consequently, they ground their generative editorial tools in external facts.",

The Ministry is drafting a new AI law that would require social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and X to include watermarks and labels on AI-generated content.\n\nFurthermore, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), a division of MeitY, is currently testing anti-deepfake technology to combat the malicious use of AI in scams targeting unsuspecting individuals.\n\nThe Parliamentary Standing Committee will be chaired by Member of Parliament Nishikant Dubey. Other participants will include representatives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Defense, the Department of Financial Services, the Department of Revenue, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, the Ministry of Power, and the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.\n\nRepresentatives from MeitY had previously briefed the Parliamentary Standing Committee on January 9 to discuss the impact of artificial intelligence-related issues. The topic of discussion was the \u201cImpact of the Emergence of Artificial Intelligence and Related Issues.\u201d The committee examined the regulation and monitoring of digital and cybercrimes.\n\nDuring Storyboard18 DNPA conclave, MeitY Secretary S Krishnan discussed the need of effective monitoring of AI regulation and how India's stance on AI balances innovation with safeguards against potential harms.\n\nAccording to him, MeitY too is closely studying regulations in other jurisdictions, including the European Union, to determine appropriate measures. India already has legal frameworks under the IT Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) that address misrepresentation and misinformation.\n\nKrishnan said, \"The advisory committee issued guidelines on March 15, 2024, addressing some concerns. If needed, the government may introduce stronger legislation, but this will be an extensive process involving stakeholder discussions. Our emphasis is on enabling AI-driven innovation while ensuring accountability through clear liability provisions.\"\n\nIn September of last year, MeitY issued an advisory to social media platforms instructing them to take prompt action in removing fake content. The Ministry also required platforms to seek government approval before releasing any untested or unreliable AI models for Indian users.\n\nIn a written response to a question in the Lok Sabha on July 31, 2024, Jitin Prasada, Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology, emphasized that the Ministry has been engaging with the public and stakeholders to gather input on necessary changes to existing legislation and the potential need for new laws related to deepfakes.\n\nIn November 2023 and again in March 2024, the Ministry issued advisories to social media companies, urging them to comply with the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.

      "content": "Powerful antioxidant\n\n\n\nPMS relief\n\nLimitations of krill oil\n\nSide effects of krill oil\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to omega-3 supplements , fish oil has long been a trusted ally. In recent years, its new alternative \u2014 krill oil \u2014 has emerged as a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, packed with powerful antioxidants and a host of impressive nutrients. Derived from the microscopic, shrimp-like creatures from the icy waters of Antarctica, it boasts of a wealth of health benefits. From heart health to skin and eye health, there are many potential benefits of the new health supplement that can be absorbed more efficiently than fish oil by the body.Krill oil is rich in two key omega-3 fatty acids \u2014 EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). Both of these compounds are considered heart-healthy and also help fight inflammation.Krill oil has a powerful antioxidant called astaxanthin which is also found in salmon and shrimp. It can support eye health and also boost krill oil\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties. Some studies have even linked krill oil to better relief from dry eye symptoms compared to fish oil due to astaxanthin\u2019s protective effects. Taking krill oil by mouth for about three months can improve dry eye symptoms such as redness. Krill oil can also play a crucial role in skin aging reversal and wound healing. study published in Alternative Medicine Review, suggested that krill oil can also provide relief in tackling premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms more effectively than fish oil. Premenstrual syndrome includes a range of signs and symptoms like mood swings, tender breasts, food cravings, fatigue, and irritability.Despite its promising perks, krill oil is not a perfect solution. A study published in Hospital Pharmacy found no significant benefits of the supplement on cardiovascular health.There is another limitation of krill oil that could hinder its popularity and that is its price. Harvesting krill from the remote Antarctic Ocean is costly, requiring massive vessels capable of navigating one of the world\u2019s most treacherous sea passages. As a result, krill oil supplements can cost three to four times more than fish oil.Krill oil may cause digestive issues like bloating, nausea, and heartburn. Some people may be allergic to seafood or have shellfish allergies, they should avoid its use. It may also lead to bleeding risk if taken alongside blood thinners.Eating a balanced diet rich in omega-3 foods such as fatty fish, walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and seaweed offers a more complete package of nutrients and antioxidants without the risks that come with concentrated supplements.",

      "content": "Heatwave in Mumbai: Know how extreme heat conditions affect our health Heatwaves can pose serious health, social, environmental and economic risks. Mumbai has been experiencing an unusual heatwave in February with temperatures soaring above 37 degree Celsius. Read on to know how heatwaves impact health.\n\nMumbai has been experiencing an unusual heatwave in the month of February with temperatures crossing 37 degree Celsius. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) also issued a yellow alert for Mumbai and its surrounding areas. The agency predicted that the city will see clear skies on February 28 with a maximum temperature of 35 degree Celsius.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), heatwaves consist of periods of abnormally hot weather that can last from a few days to months where the maximum and minimum temperatures are unusually high in a location. The minimum temperature is as important as the maximum temperature as cooler nights allow the body to recover and if the nights are unusually hot, higher temperatures will be reached earlier in the day and last for longer.\n\nHeatwaves can pose serious health, social, environmental and economic risks. Here, take a look at how extreme heat conditions affect your health.\n\nHeat Exhaustion\n\nProlonged exposure to high temperatures can lead to heat exhaustion. This happens when the body becomes dehydrated and overheated. Symptoms include heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea and fainting. If untreated, heat exhaustion can progress to heatstroke which is a potentially life-threatening condition.\n\nHeatstroke\n\nThis is one of the most dangerous consequences of extreme heat. Heatstroke occurs when the body's temperature regulation system fails, causing the body\u2019s core temperature to rise above 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C). Symptoms include confusion, seizures, rapid pulse and unconsciousness. It requires immediate medical attention, as it can lead to organ failure or death.\n\nDehydration\n\nHigh temperatures cause excessive sweating which can deplete the body's fluid levels. Without sufficient hydration, the body can become dehydrated, leading to symptoms like dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness and confusion. Severe dehydration can cause kidney damage, heatstroke and even death.\n\nCardiovascular Strain\n\nExtreme heat forces the heart to work harder to pump blood to the skin's surface in an attempt to cool the body. This added strain on the cardiovascular system can be dangerous for those with pre-existing heart conditions, increasing the risk of heart attacks or strokes during a heatwave.\n\nVulnerable Populations\n\nChildren, the elderly and people with chronic health conditions are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of extreme heat. Older adults, for example, may have impaired thermoregulation, making it harder for them to regulate their body temperature. Children are also at higher risk due to their developing bodies and increased vulnerability to dehydration.\n\nALSO READ: Diabetes Symptoms: Is bad breath a sign of high blood sugar levels?

      "title": "New WHO and ITU standard aims to prevent hearing loss among gamers",
      "content": "Ahead of World Hearing Day 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are highlighting the first global standard for safe listening in video gameplay and esport activities, which aims to reduce the risk of and prevent hearing loss among gamers. Previously, no safe listening guidelines or standards existed for video gameplay devices or software.\n\n\u201cEveryone can take steps today to ensure good hearing health throughout their life,\u201d said Dr J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, WHO Assistant Director-General, Universal Health Coverage, Communicable and Noncommunicable Diseases. \u201cThe WHO/ITU safe listening standard supports governments, manufacturers, civil society, and other stakeholders to foster safe listening environments, so that people of all ages can protect their ears and hearing, and even when playing video games, do not risk hearing loss.\u201d\n\nVideo gameplay and esports are rapidly becoming one of the largest entertainment industries worldwide. About 3 billion people play video games on devices such as personal computers, video game consoles, and mobile phones, yet most devices and games lack safe listening features to protect users from harmful noise. However, gamers risk permanent hearing loss from prolonged exposure to loud sounds while gaming or listening to music. Children are particularly vulnerable due to their lower sound tolerance and growing interest in gaming.\n\nThrough the provision of information, warnings and safe listening features, the new standard aims to inform video game players of the risk to hearing loss from loud video gameplay activities and raise awareness about how they can practice safe listening.\n\n\u201cAs video gaming and esports continue to grow and gamers use a wider array of devices to access their content, safe listening standards are vital to help protect the hearing of users, especially children, from sounds which could damage their hearing,\u201d said Seizo Onoe, Director, Telecommunication Standardization Bureau, International Telecommunication Union. \u201cCreating effective technical standards requires collaboration which leverages each other's strengths. We are grateful to our partners at WHO for their insight and experience advancing safe listening, and are pleased to launch this update on World Hearing Day.\u201d\n\nStandards protect hearing for all types of video game players\n\nThe WHO-ITU Global standard on safe listening for video gameplay and esports is designed to protect hearing for all types of video game players, across a wide range of gameplay scenarios and equipment. The standard provides separate guidelines for video gameplay devices (video game consoles, handheld or mobile devices and personal computers, headphones and headsets), and video game software.\n\nFor video gameplay devices, the standard recommends:\n\nSound allowance tracking to measure the player\u2019s sound exposure.\n\nSafe listening messages that provide players with information on sound usage, including predictions on when their sound limit will be reached.\n\nA user-friendly volume control system that can be easily adjusted.\n\nA \u201cheadphone safety mode\u201d that automatically adjusts the volume when a player changes between headphones and loudspeakers.\n\nFor video gameplay software titles, the standard recommends:\n\nSafe listening warnings and messages for players about the risk of hearing loss from loud sounds and prolonged exposure during gameplay activities.\n\nIndependent volume controls for different sound categories, allowing players to adjust levels and mute various sounds within the game.\n\nAdapting the soundtrack, genre and sound design of each game with safe listening features\n\nA \u201cheadphone safety mode\u201d within the software that is capable of detecting a switch of audio output between headphones and speakers and automatically reduces the volume.\n\nThe new standard was developed under WHO\u2019s Make Listening Safe initiative which seeks to improve listening practices especially among young people, drawing on the latest evidence and consultations with a range of stakeholders including experts from WHO, government, industry, consumers, and civil society.\n\nIn addition to the new global standard released today, two other standards for safe listening were launched in 2019 and 2022, including the H.870 WHO-ITU Global standard for safe listening personal audio devices and systems and the WHO Global standard for safe listening in venues and events (also adopted by ITU in 2024).\n\nLearn more about World Hearing Day 2025 and the Make Listening Safe initiative: https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-hearing-day/2025\n\nNotes to editors\n\nAbout the World Health Organization\n\nDedicated to the health and well-being of all people and guided by science, the World Health Organization leads and champions global efforts to give everyone, everywhere, an equal chance at a safe and healthy life. We are the UN agency for health that connects nations, partners and people on the front lines in 150+ locations \u2013 leading the world\u2019s response to health emergencies, preventing disease, addressing the root causes of health issues and expanding access to medicines and health care.

      "title": "What\u2019s lacking in the One Health approach at present? Integrated data systems and multidisciplinary approaches, say experts",
      "content": "One of the biggest threats in the world today from zoonotic diseases \u2014 diseases that jump from animals to humans. With the rise of new and re-emerging diseases, it\u2019s clear that addressing these risks requires a coordinated, cross-sectoral approach. It is here that the One Health approach, focussing on the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health is gaining traction.\n\nBut despite growing interest in and significance given to this by both Central and State governments, a true multidisciplinary approach and integrated data systems are still missing -- and these are vital to the success of the One Health approach, say experts.\n\nTake the case of the existing One Health panels\u2014such as those set up by State governments in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu\u2014these are often dominated by public health and veterinary professionals, with ecologists and social scientists notably absent, points out Abi T. Vanak, senior fellow and director at the Centre for Policy Design, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment. Understanding the dynamics of zoonotic diseases, he underscores, requires a multidisciplinary approach. To truly address the complexity of One Health, experts in systems thinking and ecological linkages must be included to provide a comprehensive, 360-degree perspective.\n\nWhen addressing zoonotic diseases, he says, the focus should be on the interactions between systems rather than isolating diseases within specific groups, whether human or animal. Understanding how pathogens flow through these systems and identifying the environmental conditions that enable their emergence is essential.\n\nSoumya Swaminathan, chairperson of the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation and former Chief Scientist at the World Health Organization, also emphasises that a multisectoral action plan is essential to promote collaboration between sectors such as health, agriculture, and the environment. This approach is crucial to mitigating shared threats -- in particular zoonotic diseases. Dr. Swaminathan also stresses that the One Health framework demands a coordinated effort to tackle the complex challenges arising from the interactions between humans, animals, and the environment.\n\nAnd so, rebranding existing veterinary, human, or public health practices as \u2018One Health\u2019 without integrating broader ecological and social factors misses the point, says Mr. Vanak. For example, while genetic surveillance or wastewater analysis for zoonotic diseases may be valuable, viewing these from a purely public health lens doesn\u2019t reflect the full One Health approach. A true One Health perspective requires examining the origins, transmission pathways, and environmental factors facilitating the spread of pathogens.\n\nThe need for surveillance and data sharing\n\nEffective surveillance is key in this regard. Mr. Vanak notes that surveillance within One Health should function on multiple levels. Reactive surveillance responds to known outbreaks, while baseline surveillance monitors the prevalence of key zoonotic diseases in both wild and domestic animals. Horizon scanning, identifying emerging pathogens before they spill over into humans, is also crucial. This surveillance needs to extend beyond forested areas and into urban environments, where humans and animals interact regularly.\n\nCurrently, data-sharing mechanisms between the veterinary and human health sectors are weak. For instance, diseases like leptospirosis are commonly reported in livestock, yet there is little communication between animal health departments and public health agencies, leaving human health professionals unaware of potential outbreaks. Experts argue that strengthening national reporting databases\u2014such as the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP)\u2014by integrating animal health data and overlaying it with environmental and meteorological information would create a more robust, predictive system.\n\nThe Indian government is exploring ways to build structures that can enable integrated surveillance of both human and animal diseases and enhance outbreak investigations. While progress has been piecemeal, experts see it as a positive starting point. A national network of laboratories is also being planned to research vaccines and other medical solutions, though these initiatives are still in development. Dr. Swaminathan says that deliberations are ongoing regarding the creation of an integrated data bank, stressing that while too much information can be overwhelming, efforts are being made to organise and streamline the data effectively.\n\nLooking beyond zoonotic diseases\n\nJaya Shreedhar, Senior Health Media Advisor, Internews, raises a concern that there is currently too much focus on zoonotic diseases and not enough attention on climate science. She calls for strengthened intersectoral collaboration, particularly between the environment, forestry, and climate science sectors, to address the broader ecological factors influencing disease emergence.\n\nMr. Vanak adds that other countries are already investing heavily in surveillance and analytics. India needs to build its capacity for spatially explicit disease monitoring, potentially using platforms like the Health Heat Map as a model. A centralised system for visualising and analysing disease patterns would enhance early detection and response, bridging the gaps between human, animal, and environmental health.",

      "content": "1\n\n2\n\nBhubaneswar: Union health minister J P Nadda on Friday expressed concern over the sluggish pace of some states in utilising healthcare funds allocated by the Centre.After inaugurating the 9th National Summit on \u2018Good and Replicable Practices and Innovation in the Public Healthcare System ' in Puri, Nadda urged senior health officials from various states and Union Territories to ensure timely and efficient utilisation of the allocated resources. \"Finance is not the problem at all. We must ensure that the finance is perfectly utilised and the quality of healthcare increases,\" he said.\"After we provide funds for a project, a tender is not floated on time, and a building is not constructed as per schedule, a machine is not purchased, and equipment is not procured. Ultimately, what happens is your next year National Health Mission (NHM) budget and your programme implementation plan become less ambitious because previous work is not completed. You have to be very careful and aggressive so that you address the problem,\" the minister said.Nadda said that the Centre has also given a lot of impetus to tertiary healthcare in addition to improving primary and secondary healthcare. \"The decline of Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) in India is double that of the global decrease, which highlights the efforts made in strengthening the healthcare system from the grassroots level. The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and under-5 mortality rate have also seen a noteworthy downfall,\" he added.On the threat from non-communicable diseases, Nadda stressed the need for lifestyle changes. He said the Centre is strengthening the healthcare sector at the grassroots level by giving importance to health workers. He put emphasis on telemedicine to help people at the grassroots level. \"They also focus on preventive, promotive and comprehensive measures,\" he added.\"We have done a great job in combating malaria and TB. We have already detected 5 lakh TB patients before 100 days. It shows the sincerity of our campaign. Jan Bhagidari (involving public representatives) has played a great role in TB-mukt Bharat,\" he added.CM Mohan Charan Majhi said a slew of national institutes are coming up in the state, including the National Institute of Yoga and Naturopathy, the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), and a National Institute of Speech and Hearing. He also said that a new govt nursing college and four dental colleges will be opened in the state.Majhi said that the merging of Odisha's Gopabandhu Jan Arogya Yojana with Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) is a momentous step to provide healthcare facilities to people in the state.The summit, which brings together key healthcare administrators from across the country, focuses on improving public healthcare delivery systems. The two-day event will showcase and document various best practices and innovations adopted by states and UTs for addressing their public health challenges, official sources said.",

He will remain in hospital due to a complex clinical picture, the Vatican said on Friday morning. It added the 88-year-old had another \"peaceful night\" and is \"now resting\" in Rome's Gemelli Hospital. Italian news agency Ansa reported that the pontiff was now out of the \"critical phase\", citing Vatican sources.\n\nThe Pope was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. Then, on 22 February, the Vatican said that the Pope had experienced a respiratory crisis and was in a \"critical\" condition, but later on Sunday released an update saying that he had \"not presented any further respiratory crises\". The following day, the Pope issued a statement asking Catholics to pray for him after he was unable to deliver the traditional Angelus prayer in person for the second week running. But, while the Vatican said the Pope's health is improving, it added that \"further days of clinical stability are necessary to resolve the prognosis\".",

Download ETHealthworld App Get Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles Scan to download App\n\nLondon: The mpox outbreak is still a public health emergency , the World Health Organization said on Thursday.The WHO, which first declared the emergency in August last year, said its decision was based on the continuing rise in the number of mpox cases and the geographic spread of the outbreak.The agency added that violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo , which has hampered its response plan, was also a factor.A public health emergency of international concern is the WHO's highest form of alert, and is declared by the agency's Director-General after advice from a group of external experts. A different form of mpox was also labelled as an emergency in 2022-2023.The new form of mpox, clade Ib , continues to predominantly affect the Democratic Republic of Congo, but Uganda and Burundi are also significantly affected, according to a recent report from the WHO. There have also been travel-related cases in countries including Thailand and Britain.Globally, there have been more than 21,000 cases confirmed by laboratory testing since the beginning of 2024, including 70 deaths, mainly in Congo, according to the WHO. Last year, there were also more than 50,000 suspected cases, and more than 1,000 deaths. Confirming cases has been challenging in areas with less capacity.Mpox is a viral infection that spreads through close contact and typically causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild, but can be lethal.(Reporting by Jennifer Rigby and Harshita Meenaktshi; Editing by Alex Richardson)",

      "content": "Turmeric\n\nGreen tea\n\nAshwagandha\n\nGarcinia cambogia\n\nRed yeast rice\n\nBlack cohosh\n\nHow to stop your nails from breaking often\n\nIn this day and age, where health often takes a backseat, mostly due to an unhealthy diet, we tend to compensate for it by popping dietary supplements. From multivitamins to calcium and fish oil, you can easily find OTC supplements in nearby stores.58% of U.S. adults take dietary supplements, including 64% of women and 51% of men, according to the 2017\u201318 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A 2024 poll suggests that 75% of adults take supplements.A 2022 study published in the journal Liver Transplantation points out that drug-induced acute live failure tied to herbal and dietary supplements had increased eightfold from 1995 through 2020. The herbal and dietary supplements contribute to roughly 20% of liver toxicity cases nationwide, according to 2017 research published in the journal Hepatology.Does that mean you should toss away your multivitamin stash and other dietary supplements? However, it is important to know what you are incorporating into your routine.Researchers at the University of Michigan noted last year that 15.6 million Americans consume products containing at least one of these six botanicals linked to liver damage:\u201cIn a previous study, we found that there was a great deal of mislabeling of some of these products. We performed analytical chemistry and found about a 50% mismatch between the stated ingredients on the label and what they actually contained, which is quite alarming. If you buy a supplement and it says it has a certain ingredient, it\u2019s basically a coin flip if that\u2019s true or not,\u201d senior author Dr. Robert Fontana, a Michigan Medicine hepatologist, said in a release.\u201cWe weren't aware that so many people were taking these supplements. So, when doctors see patients in the office, they don't necessarily ask about supplement use or take into consideration their effects,\" Likhitsup, who's also a transplant hepatologist adds.Many studies also suggested that toxic heavy metal contamination was found in some supplements. Many herbal supplements often labeled as 'natural' are not inherently safe and do not require review or approval by the US FDA before being sold. Additionally, they may cause side effects, and some herbs can interact with medications a person is already taking.Though the FDA regulates supplements, the federal agency does not review them for safety, quality, and effectiveness. The FDA regulates them as food, not drugs. So, it is up to the manufacturers to properly label their products, and then the FDA reviews after they hit the market.FDA has notified about the healthy risks of taking supplements. \"FDA advises consumers to be informed and talk to their doctor, pharmacist, or other healthcare professional before deciding to purchase or use a dietary supplement,\" the agency advises.\"Many supplements contain ingredients that can have strong effects in the body. Additionally, some supplements can interact with medications, interfere with lab tests, or have dangerous effects during surgery. Your health care professional can help you decide what supplement, if any, is right for you,\" the FDA adds.The best way to stay safe is to communicate with your healthcare providers about the supplements you are taking. Also, don\u2019t fall for \u2018megadosing\u2019 trends for speedy results. The Office of Dietary Supplements, part of the National Institutes of Health, has established daily upper limits (ULs) for safe consumption. For instance, adults shouldn\u2019t consume more than 100 micrograms of vitamin D in a day.The indiscriminate use of health supplements can do more harm than good and the supplements must be taken only on the advise of a health expert. And it is always possible that taking too much of a supplement can lead to an overdose.If you think that a dietary supplement may have caused you or someone you know to have a serious reaction or illness, immediately stop using the product and fill out a safety report through the Safety Reporting Portal to submit your complaint to FDA.",

      "content": "Andrew Benintendi out 4-6 weeks as White Sox lose top home run hitter to injury (Image Source: Getty)\n\nWhite Sox must replace attack void left by Benintendi\n\nWoe injury brings White Sox depth issues into sharp focus\n\nThe Chicago White Sox have been struck with a severe blow by discovering Andrew Benintendi, their leading home run hitter, sidelined for 4-6 weeks following the breakage of his right hand. The break was discovered following the procurement of medical scans for him after the latest game. His absence follows a struggling White Sox offense to start with, and losing one of their best-hitting bats just puts more pressure on the shoulders of a team that is trying to salvage its season.The departure of Andrew Benintendi leaves an evident absence within Chicago's offense, both as a hitter and as a regular presence. Thus far this year, Andrew Benintendi has been one of the few silver linings in the White Sox, leading them in home runs and providing stability in the middle of the order.Without Benintendi, it will be manager Pedro Grifol who will need to retool his outfield and line-up to create offense from pinch-hitting material. There are a few younger players who may receive some additional playing time in the games, but nobody has established set-up production or experience like Benintendi.The latest gaffe is symptomatic of an overall trend for the White Sox, whose own inconsistencies and injuries have plagued them the past couple seasons. The loss of Benintendi will test the depth of the team's talent at a time when they can least afford to lose any of its contributors. The overall lack of offense on the part of the team combined with their top home run threat implies a reduction in the margin for error by which this roster will have to play.If the White Sox are going to continue to compete with Benintendi in the fold, they could end up being pressured into seeking outside help to fill the void or doing a complete overhaul in hopes of jumpstarting the offense. The next 4-6 weeks, quite possibly, are what will continue to keep the White Sox on pace to get their season started in the right direction, or if finally the time has arrived to begin making moves for the future in rebuilding efforts.Also Read: Gavin Sheets failed to \u2018fit on the roster\u2019 despite attracting Chicago White Sox\u2019s interest 'at one point'",

      "content": "Albert Pujols set to return to the WBC as the Dominican Republic\u2019s manager in 2026 (Image Source: Getty)\n\nA legendary career transitions to management\n\nBuilding a formidable support team\n\nAlbert Pujols will return to the World Baseball Classic (WBC) in 2026, but he'll trade in his uniform to become the much anticipated manager of the Dominican Republic national team . The fans are expecting that this appointment heralds an exciting chapter in Pujols' storied career, moving from a famed player to a position of leadership in the international stage.Albert Pujols, one of the best to ever play the game, has taken to management like a fish to water. In February 2024, he was named manager of Los Leones del Escogido , a major team in the Dominican Republic Professional Baseball League (LIDOM). The team finished strong under his guidance, winning the league title and then claiming the Caribbean Series from Mexico\u2019s Charros de Jalisco.Pujols' time in the dugout also included a memorable moment with his former St. Louis Cardinals teammate Yadier Molina. The legends played against each other as managers in the Dominican Winter League, where Pujols\u2019 Leones del Escogido defeated Molina\u2019s \u00c1guilas Cibae\u00f1as, 2-1, at Estadio Cibao in Santiago.Pujols is heavily involved in laying the groundwork and bringing in a strong support staff for the Dominican Republic as it prepares for the 2026 WBC. He is working in close concert with the general manager, Nelson Cruz, and they have a cadre of assistants that includes luminaries like David Ortiz, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, Vladimir Guerrero, Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9, Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n and the great Juan Marichal. With a group featuring 22 former major leaguers, this collection of baseball greats hopes to lead the Dominican team to glory during the upcoming tournament.That fact alone says a lot about Pujols' desire to win and his active role in the leadership and building of the team. His vision for how the Dominican Republic would perform in the WBC combines respect for the game's values with the innovative thinking that the DR believes will help it achieve competitive distinction.Now that the 2026 World Baseball Classic is approaching, we're looking forward to seeing who will be leading the Dominican Republic team, and also hope to see the impact that Albert Pujols can have on them. His journey from playing great to managing great speaks volumes about his lifelong dedication to the game and his country.Also Read: Albert Pujols eyes WBC role with Juan Soto after leading Leones to LIDOM title",

      "content": "Champions Trophy (AP Photo)\n\nGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.\n\nCan India overcome New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy?\n\nNEW DELHI: Australia secured their place in the semifinals of the Champions Trophy after their crucial Group B clash against Afghanistan was abandoned due to rain. The match was halted when Australia were 109 for 1 in 12.5 overs, chasing a target of 274 set by Afghanistan.Despite the ground staff's efforts, the umpires declared the match abandoned after an inspection due to persistent pools of water on the pitch. The interruption occurred just an hour before the cut-off time for completing the match.With the game called off, Australia advanced to the semifinals with four points, while their previous match against South Africa in Rawalpindi was also abandoned.At the time of the interruption, Travis Head was in excellent form, having scored 59 runs off 40 balls, including nine fours and one six. He was dropped on six by Rashid Khan, but capitalised on the opportunity, dominating the Afghan bowlers.Earlier, Afghanistan posted a competitive total of 273, thanks to Sediqullah Atal 's gritty 85 and Azmatullah Omarzai 's explosive 67. Atal anchored the innings, while Omarzai's late fireworks propelled Afghanistan past 270 after they were 235 for 8 following Rashid Khan's dismissal.As it happened: Australia qualify for semis; Afghanistan mathematically alive Afghanistan's chances of progressing are slim and depend on the result of Saturday's match between South Africa and England. If South Africa wins, they will top the group with five points.If England emerges victorious, South Africa and Afghanistan will both finish on three points, leading to a net run-rate (NRR) calculation, which is likely to eliminate Afghanistan unless South Africa loses by a substantial margin.",

      "title": "India favourites to win Champions Trophy: Michael Clarke - Sports News Portal",
      "content": "Michael Clarke will be commentating on the IPL. His podcast, the Beyond 23 podcast, all of us watch. He\u2019s spoken at length about the Champions Trophy and this interview is also leading into the Trailblazers Conclave.\n\nQuestion from Gargi Raut of RevSportz: If India wins the Champions Trophy, like the T20 World Cup, should Rohit Sharma retire on a high or would you want him to continue?\n\nI think it\u2019s up to Rohit. I think with a lot of these senior players in all teams, not just India, when you\u2019ve given so much to your country, you\u2019ve played for such a long period of time and had so much success, you like to see them leave on their own terms. So I think that would really be determined by Rohit. If he feels like he\u2019s had enough, then he has that option to retire. If he wants to continue to play, then I think he\u2019s certainly still in good enough form to keep playing.\n\nQuestion from Rajarshi Ganguly, the sports editor of Sangbad Pratidin: All of us thought this is a weakened Australian side, but look at what they are doing. Are you surprised or is it about something that happens to the Australian team ICC tournaments?\n\nNo. I\u2019m not surprised that Australia are playing the way they\u2019re playing. I think our batting has a lot of experience. It\u2019s just our bowling \u2014 because we\u2019re missing (Mitchell) Starc, (Josh) Hazelwood and (Pat) Cummins \u2014 that is a little bit less experienced. But a lot of these guys have all played a certain amount of games for Australia in the lead-up to this tournament. I think they\u2019ve been waiting for an opportunity, to be honest. I think we\u2019re certainly good enough to make the final. And this team will be a lot more confident now, particularly after that win against England.\n\nSecond question from Rajarshi Ganguly: You have always supported Virat Kohli. Were you surprised at the way he played against Pakistan?\n\nNot surprised one bit. I think the great players always seem to stand up when they\u2019re under pressure or when the team needs them the most. I love seeing him in the nets. It was an hour and a half before training started the day before that Pakistan game. That shows there were areas he wanted to work on, but it also shows how important it is for him to still go out there and make runs. And he batted like a genius.\n\nQuestion from Shutopa Bhowmik, sports editor of Aajkaal newspaper: Who is likely to win the Champions Trophy? Will it once again turn out to be Australia\u2019s, because all of us are completely in awe of the way they are playing.\n\nI think Australia will be in the final and I think they\u2019ll be playing India. I want Australia to win, but I actually think India is going to win the Champions Trophy. I think they\u2019re the best, they\u2019re the number one team in the world at the moment. The fact they\u2019re playing in the conditions in Dubai where if they do make the final, that\u2019s where the final will be. Their team really suits those conditions. Three wonderful spinners, in conditions that are probably a little bit slower paced than Pakistan. So I think it\u2019ll be Australia-India final and I think India will win by one run.\n\nQuestion from Sucharita Sen Chaudhary, Allsportsindia.com: You said in your podcast that Rohit Sharma will be one of the highest run getters in the Champions Trophy. Why did you say it and how sure were you that Rohit will come back to form?\n\nHe\u2019s back in form, there\u2019s no doubt about it. I think that 100 he made in India before the Champions Trophy showed he\u2019s certainly hitting the ball well. He\u2019s got an important role, particularly in those conditions. He\u2019s got to play with that aggressive intent. He\u2019s got to maximise the power play. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if India were to win the Champions Trophy and Rohit Sharma was the leading run scorer.\n\nQuestion from Sanchita Chatterjee of Tripura Darpan: What is your view about the IPL?\n\nI absolutely love it. I think it\u2019s been amazing for the game. It\u2019s brought a lot of nations together, a lot of players together. It\u2019s improved the way cricket\u2019s played. You see players playing shots that they\u2019ve learnt through playing in the IPL and T20 cricket. It\u2019s been amazing for the game. I love being a part of it, when I played and now to commentate.\n\nQuestion from Anirban Sengupta of Aajkaal: Do you agree that India is the powerhouse of world cricket at the moment?\n\nYes, I certainly do. I think there\u2019s a handful of teams certainly in Test cricket that on their given day, in their own conditions, particularly, they\u2019re tough to beat. I think winning a series in India is as tough as it gets. You know, I thought Australia played very well against India in the Test series last summer out here in Australia. But in the one-day format, I think they\u2019re the number one team in the world. They\u2019re very dominant.\n\nQuestion from Nitika Chakraborty of Khash Khabar: Do you believe Snicko is not 100% consistent? And what is the solution? Because there is always an element of doubt.\n\nMy take on technology is if you get it 100% right, then use it. My concern is that we don\u2019t use the same technology all the time. Some countries use it. Some countries don\u2019t. Some countries use Hotspot or Snicko. Some countries don\u2019t. I think it\u2019s got to be one in, all in. I think if we\u2019re going to use it, if we think it\u2019s better for the game, then I think it should be used in every single game.\n\nQuestion from Sudipto Bhattacharya of Aaraukhamon: How excited are you about cricket\u2019s inclusion in the Olympics?\n\nIf I was playing, I\u2019d love to go to an Olympic Games, to have the chance to win a medal would be unreal. So I\u2019m excited that it\u2019s in the Olympics. But I don\u2019t know if cricket needs to be in there. I\u2019m excited to speak to the players about what it\u2019s like. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll love it. And then make a decision after that.\n\nQuestion from Shamik Chakrabarty of RevSportz: Has the IPL revolutionised cricket?\n\nWell, definitely, T20 cricket. It\u2019s changed the way the game is played. It\u2019s brought a lot of countries and players together. The friendships and relationships that are made now, particularly because of the IPL, it\u2019s been great for the game.\n\nQuestion from Shubhashish Ghosh of Kolkata 24\u00d77: Which match against India stands out the most for you as a player?\n\nI had so many great games against India. My very first game for Australia was in Bangalore in 2004. Making my debut, to walk out and bat for my country for the first time and be in Bangalore and play against India and to win that series, was very special. To win in India is so hard. Making 300 at my home ground in Sydney was very special as well. So, yeah, I cherished my games against India. I found they\u2019re always a tough opposition and I had to be at my best to try and score runs.\n\nQuestion from Gautam Bhattacharya of National Herald: Given Australia\u2019s awesome record in ICC finals, how do you fancy their chances against South Africa in the WTC final?\n\nIs that game at Lord\u2019s? Yeah. I think those conditions will suit them. I know South Africa have a good bowling attack. But those conditions will also suit the Australian bowlers. If our three fast bowlers, and add Scott Bolalnd to that and Nathan Lyon, I think they\u2019ll be tough to face over there. I think Australia will win that game.\n\nQuestion from Orchito Chatterjee of Sportslight Media: What is the secret behind Australia\u2019s success in every ICC tournament?\n\nI think Australia looks forward to the big moments, the big tournaments. A lot of people ask, why do we win World Cups or major events. The only thing I can sort of put it down to is, I think we probably don\u2019t fear losing as much as we are excited about trying to win. You make decisions throughout a game where sometimes you can have the fear of it not working or you can have the fear of one decision costing your team the game. But I think I was always willing to risk losing to try and win. I loved winning. I accepted that sometimes you\u2019re going to lose. But I don\u2019t think that fear of losing was in the front of my mind.\n\nQuestion from Bijoy Broto Bhattacharya of Pustak Publication: What advice would you give to young cricketers aspiring to play at the highest level, especially in terms of mental toughness and handling failure?\n\nPractice, practice, practice. You learn so many of your lessons in training. There\u2019s no truer saying than the harder you work, the lucky you get. I believe in that. I believe in hard work, discipline, being in the nets as a batter or bowler, working on fielding. I think the mental side of the game comes with preparation. If you can walk out onto the field and know you\u2019ve put in all the work off the field in your preparation, I think that gives you a lot of self-confidence.\n\nTwo questions on Jasprit Bumrah, one from Shayan Gupta of Aajkaal and one from Rohan Chowdhury of RevSportz: So far, India hasn\u2019t felt the absence of Bumrah. Who will you give credit for this? And how should India handle Bumrah? Should he be risked in the IPL? Because we have the England Test series coming up.\n\nWell, it\u2019s a tough one because you want him playing every game. He\u2019s the best bowler in the world at the moment in all three formats. I think India have done exceptionally well in this Champions Trophy so far without him. But every team in the world will be a stronger with Bumrah in it. So I think conditions have probably played a part.\n\nBumrah seems like the type of guy that wants to play in the IPL for his franchise. He wants to play every game he can for India. So I think he\u2019ll need to be managed the right way. And I think you can rest him for individual games at the right time. But yeah, of course, you want the best players playing. So I hope he\u2019s fully fit. I hope he plays a majority of the IPL. And then you definitely want to see him in those Test matches against England.\n\nQuestion from Boria Majumdar: In the 50-over format, Shubman Gill has really sort of come of age. Your thoughts on Gill? In this particular format, is he now ready to kind of be the successor to Virat Kohli?\n\nI think he\u2019s a wonderful player. And I think he complements this, you know, this Indian top order. I think having Rohit Sharma at the top with him allows him to play his natural game. They bat well together. The experience of Virat coming in at three, I think they complement each other really well. I think it\u2019s just a matter of time before he dominates all three formats. He\u2019s confident in the way he plays. He\u2019s got all the shots. Yeah, I\u2019m not surprised.\n\nQuestion from Boria Majumdar: About Jay Shah becoming the ICC chairman, can he handle it?\n\nCredit to Jay because so far, at least organisation-wise, the Champions Trophy has done very well. There have been in the past a lot of questions, etc. But credit where due. They have been able to do it well. I think he\u2019s done a wonderful job so far. I love that he wants to prioritize Test cricket.\n\nAlso Read: The thought behind the Trailblazers Conclave",

      "content": "Ryan ten Doeschate indicates changes in India's playing XI, selection still a dilemma India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate opened up on the importance of beating New Zealand and carrying the momentum to the semi-final but indicated that a few players might be rested as they will get only one day rest in between.\n\nThe Indian team is still in a dilemma whether to bench some of the players in the final league game against New Zealand or play them. The Rohit Sharma-led side will be playing the Black Caps on March 2, followed by their semi-final game on March 4. A rest for some of the senior cricketers would mean that they will be fresh for the semis but the team management doesn\u2019t want the move to kill their momentum in the ongoing Champions Trophy.\n\nIndia won back-to-back matches against Bangladesh and Pakistan and a defeat against New Zealand can put them under pressure ahead of the semis. The team management understands that and for the same reason, nothing has been decided so far. A few reports claimed that Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Shami might get a rest but KL Rahul in the press conference stated that it might not be the case.\n\nIndia\u2019s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate meanwhile noted that the semi-final match is the priority but added the importance of finding the right balance. He believes that beating New Zealand is key to carrying the momentum and mentioned that the team wants to head to the semi-final as the league leaders.\n\n\u201cWe've had two pretty tough training sessions, so that's been the preparation. In terms of the bench strength, I think the priority is making sure that we have our best guys available and fully fit for the second game (semifinal on March 4),\" Doeschate told reporters.\n\n\u201cBut we also don't want to rest them for another two days. So to get that balance right, we might just try to share the bowling out a little bit. But we obviously want to win against New Zealand as well. It's important that we keep that momentum going. And obviously to top the group as well. So the balance of those two things I just mentioned for the selection to be thought about,\" he added.",

Australia had a target of 274 runs to chase down, and opener Travis Head propelled his side to an exceptional start in the run chase.\n\nHowever, as rain interrupted play midway into the second innings, the game was eventually abandoned. With one win and two no results, Australia currently occupies the top spot in their group and have qualified for the semi-final of the tournament.\n\nSpeaking of the game between Afghanistan and Australia, the clash began with Afghanistan coming in to bat first.

As things stand, Virat will play his 300th ODI game against New Zealand on March 2 at Dubai International Stadium.\n\nStar India batter Virat Kohli is all set to play his 300th ODI match in his career. With that, he will become the seventh Indian cricketer to play 300 or more matches in the format. Kohli is set to achieve the milestone in India\u2019s Champions Trophy match against New Zealand at Dubai International Stadium on March 2.\n\nAhead of that, New Zealand cricketer Michael Bracewell congratulated Kohli for the \u2018massive achievement\u2019 and noted that it\u2019s even more special to play so many games in just one format. He added that playing against India will be a tough challenge as the Rohit Sharma-led side has quality players in the ranks but they are up for the fight.\n\n\u201cThat's a massive, massive achievement. 300 games across a career is very impressive. And then to put that in just one format is amazing. I think it's a testament to the way that he's gone about his career. And it's very impressive. And he's one of a number of class players in the Indian line-up,\u201d Bracewell said in the press conference.\n\n\u201cAnd yeah, they've all played a lot of cricket now. So as I said, they're going to be a challenging team to come up against. But we're really excited about that challenge. They (India) have obviously got great players across the board, Virat being one of them. He's scored a lot of hundreds in one-day cricket. So he's obviously a player that has done it over a number of years. So, yeah, we're excited to play against India and the challenge that that provides. They've got class players across the board and so do we. So hopefully it's a great match,\u201d he added.\n\nThe match between India and New Zealand will decide the group leader.

The appointment made in May 2024 has adopted the tolerance of discipline, camaraderie, devotion, and a whole new dimension for the team. Berube is not only revamping the players but could also have revived quite some lost hope among the fans, taking a cut above the rest in the games in the Eastern Conference.Berube spoke his mind on the journey so far in a phone interview on the show \"Real Kyper & Bourne,\" hosted by Sportsnet 590 THE FAN. Praising the players for their commitment and professional conduct, the 58-year-old coach highlighted the features of their consistency and work ethic along with preparation.\u201cThis team was a breath of fresh air for me,\u201d Berube said. \u201cTo come in and see how hard they work and how hard they compete every day, and just their preparation was, in my opinion, first class.What he inherited after Sheldon Keefe's contract expired is an early exit from the playoffs in Toronto. He has proven that experience, including having won a Stanley Cup with the St. Louis Blues in 2019, is a telling factor in remaking the performance of the Leafs this season. Building an enjoyable place and demanding excellence are factors that the players in the team credit toward their progress.This was reflected in a recent 5-4 overtime victory over the Boston Bruins, with scant minutes left to bring the score level by Pontus Holmberg and Mitch Marner achieving the exhilarating overtime-winning third goal of the night at 4:04 in overtime.\u201cBig goal there 6-on-5 by Holmberg, and we didn\u2019t quit,\" Marner said via NHL.com. \"That\u2019s what we like to see out of our team.\" That win moved the Leafs up to 74 points in their 58 games played in the Eastern Conference.Also Read: Penguins Goalie Alex Nedeljkovic\u2019s Frustration Boils Over in Win Against Flyer Craig Berube infused into the Toronto Maple Leafs a new kind of vision. Under his leadership, a team redefining mental attitude that is made up of hardworking people who are going to see the postseason from a different angle has emerged. The renewed spirit and collective intent as instilled by Berube already put the Leafs in a position to attract attention. As the journey continues, both the Maple Leafs and their fans have plenty to look forward to in the coming days, driven by their coach's determination to inspire the best from his players.",

My dad played 19 years in the NHL. I remember him telling us at a young age that you have to be well-rounded. You have to enjoy going from one group of friends to your other group of friends. Baseball team in summer, school soccer team, what else did we play, Brady, basketball, soccer\u2026Lacrosse.We could swing some sticks and play golf in the summer. I remember after hockey season, we might have played a few spring tournaments, just one summer tournament just to hang out with some friends. I want to give the credit to our parents because it helped grow our love for hockey more because when you are playing other sports, you are almost excited again for hockey season.I think multisports makes you so much better as an overall athlete.Do you think they (NHL) are going to continue doing this (4 Nations Face-Off)? It was so massively successful. Do you think the NHL is going to continue to lean into in future seasons?Brady Tkachuk: I think they (NHL) have come up with a plan. This (4 Nations Face-Off) was more successful than they could have pictured. Next year, we got the Olympics. Then, they are doing a World Cup where they have been talking about getting more countries involved instead of the 4 Nations, they are looking for like 8 countries. They are talking about having some games in Europe. It would be a cool experience and tie that to the 2030 Olympics. They are coming up with that every two years of an event like this. Everybody missed it. But it's going to be a little bit different with all the Olympic Rules. There's not gonna be - not allowed to fight in.You gotta allow it, baby! We have been arguing to get that rule set in the NFL for years. You could imagine just once every game, you just get a F**K IT...You are allowed to take the helmet off and\u2026You and Me (chuckles).Matthew, you got into the first fight of the first game with Canada. Brady, you are next, and then Miller got in the third fight, right? Did you guys know right from the moment of the anthem that that was gonna happen?In the last years, you haven't seen that from Americans in general, to show off how proud they are to be a part of the United States. Our team did a great job of making a big impact on people from the whole tournament but especially that game against Canada\u2026going into a hostile environment and wanting to set the tone in a very tough place to play against a very great team. We knew it was going to be an intense game. Me, Brady, and Mills were talking about it before the game, you know, potentially, if there were gonna be just some scraps doing it the right away.If the feeling's right, if they set the lights that are right, and you'll get the moods right - we'll see what happens.To be honest, it was all just joking around. It made me proud to be playing for that team during that moment to see how united we were. It was more to show your teammates that we got this. We are together in this. We all come from different parts of the country, different backgrounds, you know, we are in this, and we are gonna play together.",

He batted at number six in India's opening game against Bangladesh and against Pakistan, he didn't bat at all, despite India losing four wickets.\n\nIndia\u2019s top four in the Champions Trophy has been constant, with Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill opening, followed by Virat Kohli at three and Shreyas Iyer at four. KL Rahul was expected to bat at number five but it hasn\u2019t been the case so far. Axar Patel was promoted five against Bangladesh, while Hardik Pandya batted at the same number against Pakistan, followed by Axar at number six.\n\nKL Rahul didn\u2019t have to bat in the match, else he would have come out at number seven or at eight after Ravindra Jadeja. Addressing the same, the keeper-batter noted that it\u2019s never easy to move so frequently but he understands that the team has some sort of plans. He also added that it is not easy to rotate strikes right from the beginning as the conditions in Dubai have been challenging but he and the rest of the batters are finding ways to deal with it.\n\n\u201cIt's never easy for anyone on the team to be moving in different places but yeah, that's, that's how the game goes. Whatever the team thinks is the best possible combination and what they feel is the best entry points for the player, you leave it up to the team to decide and you just try and do your job,\u201d Rahul said in the press conference.\n\n\u201cRotating the strike as soon as you go in against spinners or fast bowlers has been a little bit of a challenge. So, once those dot balls start to pile up on a batsman, obviously the pressure builds up and you have to play that big shot or you have to play really short. And that obviously gives the opposition and the bowlers an opportunity. So that has been the challenge. And we're trying to find ways to see how we can rotate the strike a lot more,\u201d he added.\n\nIndia will be playing New Zealand in their final league game of the campaign. The winner of the match will finish as the league leaders. Meanwhile, India will be playing their semi-final match on March 4 and for the same reason, they might rest a few players against the Kiwis.",

The announcement came Friday, marking a significant career move for the 50-year-old coach.Loeffler, who spent six seasons at Bowling Green, will be replacing Doug Nussmeier , who has joined former offensive coordinator Kellen Moore in New Orleans as part of the Saints' coaching staff.Under Loeffler\u2019s leadership, the Falcons posted a 7-6 record in 2024 and made three bowl game appearances during his tenure, finishing with an overall record of 27-41.

Aussie skipper Steve Smith has heaped praise on the bowling unit for coming together well and helping the team.\n\nAustralia's stand-in captain Steve Smith has praised the Australian bowlers for doing well in the clash against Afghanistan after his team secured a semifinal spot in the Champions Trophy 2025.\n\nAustralia were short of nearly six first-choice players in the 50-over tournament but have still made it to the last four from Group B. The absentees' sheet included the pace troika of Pat Cummins (also captain), Josh Hazlewood and Mitchel Starc, the three Aussie mainstays. It also includes vice-captain Mitchell Marsh, ODI retired Marcus Stoinis and Cameron Green.\n\nWhile the Aussies conceded over 350 runs against England, they restricted Afghanistan to 273 in their second match that took place without weather interruption. Smith pointed out that the team aimed to reach the semifinals. \"That's what we were after in the start, to finish in the top two and qualify for the semis. I thought the guys did a good job, made good changes and took wickets in the middle. Did well to restrict them to 270 and we were in a good position,\" said Smith in the post-match interaction with the broadcaster.\n\nHe praised the bowling unit despite it leaking 37 runs in extras, including 17 wides against Afghanistan. \"There were a few (extras) today, and Spencer (Johnson) was getting it to swing too much. Josh Inglis (wicketkeeper) was happy when that spell ended. The guys, though, did a good job, beat the bat on a few occasions,\" he said. \"It was a good performance. Shame the game was washed out.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Australia opener Matthew Short has picked up an injury, and there are doubts over his availability. Smith opened on him, saying, \"He was struggling a bit, and a few days might be too short to recover.\"\n\nAfghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi reflected on the game. \"It's unfortunate that the game went without a result. It was a good game. I think we should have scored 300-plus but they bowled well in the middle overs,\" said Shahidi.\n\n\"It (273) was a good score, but we didn't start well with the ball and gave them too much width and many hitting options. We'll learn from this.\"",

      "content": "Australian star picks up injury, dark clouds loom over Champions Trophy 2025 semifinal availability Australia have reached into the semifinals of the Champions Trophy 2025 after their fixture against Afghanistan in Lahore was washed out due to rain. However, Australia have an injury concern ahead of the semifinals of the tournament.\n\nAustralia have an injury concern going into the knockout stages of the Champions Trophy 2025. The Australian team qualified for the semifinals after the rain washed out their last group stage fixture against Afghanistan at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Friday, February 28.\n\nThe Aussies were pretty much in a strong position at 109/1 in 12.5 overs in their 274-run chase before the heaven gates opened up and washed out the clash in the end. Australia are the first team from Group B to seal their place in the last four with South Africa all but confirmed as the second side. Only a highly unlikely huge loss to England can knock them out.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia have fitness concerns about opening batter Matthew Short, who picked up an injury in the clash against Afghanistan. The right-handed opener did come out to bat in the second innings, however, Smith feels he would need a longer time to recover than he is having in the tournament.\n\n\"He was struggling a bit and a few days might be too short to recover,\" Australia stand-in captain Smith said in the post-match interaction with the broadcaster.\n\nThe Champions Trophy 2025 is about to reach its business end with only two group stage games left before the knockouts load in. The two semifinals are lined up on Tuesday and Wednesday (March 2 and 3), and the Aussies will play in either of them, depending on their final position in Group B.\n\nShort has been opening for the Australian team in the tournament alongside Travis Head and had scored 63 in the team's opener against England last week. If he is not fit to play in the semifinal next week, Australia will look to bring Jake Fraser McGurk in for him.\n\nNotably, Smith praised the bowling line-up for doing the job well after the team reached the semifinal. While the Aussies conceded over 350 runs against England, they restricted Afghanistan to 273 in their second match that took place without weather interruption. Smith pointed out that the team aimed to reach the semifinals. \"That's what we were after in the start, to finish in the top two and qualify for the semis. I thought the guys did a good job, made good changes and took wickets in the middle. Did well to restrict them to 270 and we were in a good position,\" said Smith in the post-match interaction with the broadcaster.",

Taking on Bangladesh and Pakistan so far, the Men in Blue have managed to win both matches and are well on their way to the semi-final of the competition.\n\nFor their final game of the group stage, the Men in Blue will take on New Zealand. Both sides will lock horns at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday, March 2. Ahead of the clash, star India batter KL Rahul took centre stage and talked about a variety of topics.\n\nOne of the points that he touched upon was the ever-rising competition with Rishabh Pant. A star in his own right, both KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant have often competed for a spot in the playing XI; however, according to Rahul, he is not trying to compete with Pant at all.\n\n\"There is (competition with Pant), I won't lie. He is a very talented player and has shown all of us what he can do and how aggressively he can play and how quickly he can change the game. So there is always a temptation in the team with the captain and the coach to think if they should play him or play me,\u201d Rahul said in the pre-game press conference.\n\n\"For me, whenever I get the opportunity, I try and see what I can do best. I am not trying to compete with Rishabh. I am not trying to play like him, or I am sure when he gets a chance, he is not trying to play like anybody else. He is picked on the basis of how he can play, and the same applies to me,\" Rahul added.\n\nThere have been several reports about India\u2019s playing XI for the upcoming clash against New Zealand. However, it is most likely that Rahul would feature for the Men in Blue once again in Pant\u2019s place.",

The match witnessed some remarkable individual performances and records being broken. Harsh Dubey , Vidarbha's young left-arm spinner, created history by becoming the highest wicket-taker in a single Ranji Trophy season. He claimed 3/88 in the innings, taking his tally to 69 wickets, surpassing the previous record of 68 wickets held by Bihar's Ashutosh Aman.Kerala's captain, Sachin Baby, played a valiant innings of 98 runs, while Aditya Sarwate fought hard for his 185-ball 79. However, Vidarbha's bowlers, including Dubey, Darshan Nalkande (3/52), and Parth Rekhade (3/65), shared nine wickets to dismiss Kerala for 342.Sarwate's resistance lasted 185 balls, and he shared a 63-run partnership with Baby for the fourth wicket. Baby also forged vital partnerships with Salman Nizar (49 runs for the fifth wicket) and Mohammed Azharuddeen (59 runs for the sixth wicket), but their efforts were not enough to surpass Vidarbha's first-innings total of 379.Despite some close calls with DRS interventions, Vidarbha managed to maintain their lead. Nizar and Azharuddeen were adjudged LBW after reviews, while Baby missed out on a century, getting caught at deep midwicket for 98.Kerala's lower order could not contribute significantly, and they were eventually bowled out, adding only 211 runs to their overnight score of 131/3.Vidarbha's disciplined bowling and Kerala's inability to push for runs contributed to the visitors' downfall, leaving Vidarbha with a 37-run lead at the end of day three.Vidarbha 379 in 123.1 overs (Danish Malewar 153, Karun Nair 86; MD Nidheesh 3/61, Eden Apple Tom 3/101) lead Kerala 342 in 125 overs (Aditya Sarwate 79, Sachin Baby 98; Darshan Nalkande 3/52, Harsh Dubey 3/88, Parth Rekhade 3/65) by 37 runs.",

There is little time before the semifinals, so you would want players to get maximum game time. This is my perspective, but things could change.

      "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg India on WhatsApp for exclusive content and analysis on what billionaires, businesses and markets are doing. Sign up here.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIndia\u2019s economy rebounded last quarter, offering some relief to Prime Minister Narendra Modi whose ambitious growth plans have come under pressure due to recent slowdown.\n\nGross domestic product grew 6.2% in the three months to December, the Statistics Ministry said in a statement on Friday. That figure was in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists, and much higher than a revised reading of 5.6% expansion in the July-September period.\n\nFor the full year, India\u2019s economy is forecast to grow at 6.5%, an upward revision from previous projection, the ministry said. The government expects growth rate to be below 7% in the next financial year as well.\n\nThe 10-year benchmark bond yield edged higher after the GDP numbers were published. Local stocks and the rupee closed lower ahead of the data release.\n\nA pick-up in government spending after national polls and strong rural consumption helped bolster growth in the last quarter. Government final consumption expenditure grew 8.3% in the three months to December from a year ago, compared to 3.8% in the previous quarter. Private consumption also improved during the three-month long festive season, with agriculture sector benefiting from surplus rains and a bumper harvest.\n\nWhile India is still the fastest-expanding major economy, growth is well below the 8% pace required for Modi to fulfill his bold pledge of converting the country into a developed nation by 2047. The growth prospects for the next year remain uncertain as US President Donald Trump threatens to upend global trade with tariffs.\n\nExports and a rebound in government and private spending will support growth in the last quarter of the financial year, India\u2019s Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran told reporters in a virtual briefing, adding the country\u2019s economic momentum is expected to sustain.\n\nAnalysts are not that optimistic. Even though the GDP print broadly came in line with expectations, the implied growth estimate of around 7.5% for the January- March period looks \u201csignificantly optimistic,\u201d said Upasna Bhardwaj, an economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. She expects this fiscal year\u2019s GDP figure to be lower than the government\u2019s estimate by around 20-30 basis point.\n\nStory Continues",

      "content": "The State government has once again reiterated that development of Rayalaseema can be ensured by the Godavari-Banakacherla project and also completing the pending projects. The government said it would give priority to completing pending irrigation projects.\n\nFinance Minister Payyavula Keshav, who presented the Annual Budget 2025-26 in the State Assembly on Friday, said the State government\u2019s allocations to the Water Resources Department aimed towards making the State a drought-proof one.\n\n\u201cThe farmers of Rayalaseema and North Coastal Andhra, who were waiting for water, were deceived. The previous regime didn\u2019t even care about the field channels in villages. We have even encountered washing away of dams, which did not bother the previous regime. In our case, our government was so committed that we took care of the damaged Tungabhadra dam gates overnight,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe Minister asserted that the NDA government is of the firm view that the Polavaram project on river Godavari will change the fortunes of both Rayalaseema region and North Coastal districts. \u201cNearly 2,000 tmc ft water from the Godavari flows into the sea, while Rayalaseema area suffers from drought. To achieve the ambitious goal of drought-proof state by utilising the Godavari waters, the Chief Minister has planned the mega Polavaram - Banakacherla river linking project and is exploring all possible financing options to fund this multi-billion rupees project. This project will transfer 200 tmc ft floodwater from the Godavari River to Banakacherla head regulator through a link canal and fulfil water demand in drought-prone Rayalaseema region,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMr. Keshav said the government has cleared pending payments and brought the construction of several projects back on track including the Handri Neeva Sujala Sravanthi Project, which is considered the lifeline of Rayalaseema region.\n\nIn the Agriculture Budget, the Rayalaseema region is likely to benefit with the government planning to get funds from National Horticulture Board to the horticulture crop clusters. The government said it had already sent proposals to develop Banana cluster in Anantapur and also sent proposals to the Centre for funds for mango clusters in Chittoor, Annamayya and Tirupati districts\n\nThe government also said that it had made available 3,36,500 vegetable saplings ready through the Centre of Excellence at Kuppam in Chittoor district.",

      "title": "Paperwork or people? Arvind Iyer of Piramal Finance bets on trust over docs!",
      "content": "For millions in India\u2019s tier 2 and tier 3 cities, securing a loan isn\u2019t just about interest rates and EMIs but more about clearing the invisible walls of paperwork and approvals that often stand between them and financial inclusion. Piramal Finance, through its Parakh series, aligns with its campaign \u201cHum Kagaz Se Zyada Neeyat Dekhte Hai,\u201d highlighting how intent (Neeyat) matters alongside documentation in its trust-based approach to lending.\n\nIn an industry where algorithms and credit scores dictate eligibility, Piramal Finance\u2019s approach is refreshingly personal. \u201cOur customers are largely unbanked in terms of financial instruments. Many lack the full set of paperwork the financial system traditionally demands. But does that mean they don\u2019t deserve access to credit?\u201d Arvind Iyer, Head of Marketing, Piramal Finance, told Shailja Tiwari. The company has devised an underwriting process that goes beyond traditional paperwork, blending AI-driven models with real human interaction.\n\nThe campaign itself is a departure from the usual glossy, scripted advertising that dominates the financial sector. Instead of polished testimonials, Piramal Finance, in collaboration with The Womb, has produced a series of documentary-style films capturing real customer experiences. These aren\u2019t airbrushed success stories but raw, authentic narratives of individuals who found financial support when they needed it most. The films, in Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada, highlight the regional and cultural nuances of financial struggles across India.\n\nThe marketing playbook for this campaign is as unconventional as its message. Given the long-form nature of the content\u2014seven-minute films instead of quick 30-second ad spots\u2014the digital space is the primary battleground. \u201cYouTube is our main platform, but we are also exploring OTT distribution. Theatrical release is an option too, but we\u2019ll first analyse how digital performs,\u201d Iyer explained.\n\nFor those wondering whether the campaign will find its way to television, the answer is a cautious \u2018maybe.\u2019 \u201cRadio is a strong possibility, especially for our audience, and we\u2019ve also experimented with out-of-home advertising in the past\u2014things like signage and wall paintings in smaller towns,\u201d he added. The focus remains on ensuring that the campaign reaches those who need it most, rather than blanketing urban India with ads.\n\nBeyond advertising, \u201cHum Kagaz Se Zyada Niyat Dekhte Hai\u201d is also a statement about Piramal Finance\u2019s business philosophy. Their loan offerings, from home loans and MSME loans to micro-loans against property, are structured to meet the realities of customers in semi-urban and rural India, as the company stated.\n\n\u201cOur underwriting isn\u2019t just about ticking off a checklist. It\u2019s about evaluating the reality of an individual\u2019s financial standing. We engage with our customers directly, understanding their circumstances beyond what\u2019s on paper,\u201d Iyer said. This, he believes, is what sets Piramal Finance apart from competitors that rely purely on rigid data points.\n\nThe stakes are high. With increasing competition in India\u2019s financial sector, the balance between trust and risk is a tricky one. But for Piramal Finance, the bet is clear: in a country where paperwork has often been a barrier, maybe it\u2019s time to let intent and credibility speak louder than documents.",

      "title": "Navigating 2025's Geopolitical Supply Chain Landscape",
      "content": "2025 is already facing a series of complex and interrelated geopolitical challenges with global supply chains feeling the impacts. Worryingly, experts only expect these impacts to further challenge in the coming months. From escalating conflicts to climate change, technological vulnerabilities, resource scarcity, regulatory changes, and health crises, these factors are collectively shaping how logistics professionals strategise and execute their global operations of businesses worldwide. Leading industry experts encourage businesses to adopt a resilience mindset, develop geopolitical risk mitigation techniques, and to lean into the almost constant state of crisis. By adjusting to this new normal and developing anti-fragile methods to managing these shifts, businesses can navigate these shifts with more ease, visibility and flexibility.\n\nTop Geopolitical Risks for 2025\n\nThe Global Risks Report 2025 by the World Economic Forum highlights this increasingly fractured global landscape, with escalating geopolitical, environmental, societal, and technological challenges threatening stability and progress. The report is based on the Global Risks Perception Survey 2024-2025, which gathered insights from over 900 experts worldwide.\n\nArmed Conflict\n\nAccording to the report, state-based armed conflict, including proxy wars, civil wars, coups, and terrorism, is identified as the top risk for 2025, with 23% of respondents viewing it as the most pressing threat. These conflicts disrupt trade routes, impact availability of critical materials, and destabilise regional supply networks. For instance, tensions in the South China Sea and Eastern Europe have already caused significant disruptions, forcing companies to rethink their supply chain strategies and seek alternative routes and suppliers. And due to the continued tensions in the Middle East, the security risk of commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea and Bab-el-Mandeb strait remains high, with most large container shipping companies continuing to sail around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope until safe passage through the area is ensured for the longer term.\n\nIn addition to these geopolitical tensions, the report also highlights several other top risks that are shaping the global landscape in 2025.\n\nTrade Conflict\n\nThe threat of trade conflict is prompting companies to reassess their supply chain strategies. Proposed tariffs could lead businesses to nearshore production to mitigate potential impacts. This shift, while aimed at reducing dependency on foreign suppliers, also introduces new challenges such as increased production costs and the need for new infrastructure. The economic gamble of trade conflicts underscores the importance of having a diversified and resilient supply chain that can adapt to changing trade policies and tariffs.\n\nChanging Regulations\n\nChanges in trade policies, tariffs, and regulations can impact supply chain operations, requiring companies to adapt quickly to new compliance requirements and potential cost increases. For instance, the introduction of new environmental regulations and labour laws can affect production processes and sourcing strategies. In January 2025, the world saw the implementation of the FuelEU Maritime regulations. Companies should prioritise being on top of regulatory developments, among others, and engage in proactive planning to ensure compliance and minimise disruptions. This includes investing in technologies that improve transparency and traceability across the supply chain. Businesses that fail to stay informed of regulation changes increase risks to their supply chain as well as delays in the form of customs and border-crossing areas. Karin Utternas, Customs Process Administrator at Maersk, highlights undertaking due diligence and being aware of rule changes and laws well in advance of committing to a delivery date and booking cargo for a shipment, as a highly important component of supply chains.\n\nClimate Change Risks\n\nClimate change disruptions pose another significant risk to logistics. Extreme weather instances are expected to increase in frequency and severity, such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts, which can disrupt supply chains by damaging infrastructure, affecting production, and causing delays. Companies must invest in resilient infrastructure and adopt practices to mitigate these risks. This includes optimising transportation routes to reduce climate impact and ensuring that production facilities are equipped to handle extreme weather conditions. Additionally, with the changes climate change can bring, businesses and consumers may end up with higher costs overall, resulting in further pain points.\n\nFuture Pandemics\n\nHealth crises are also a concern, according to the report. While less immediate, the potential for future pandemics remains a concern, as they can disrupt labour forces, manufacturing, and logistics networks, besides a heavy human toll. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerabilities in global supply chains, with widespread disruptions in production and transportation. Companies should develop robust contingency plans and invest in technologies that enhance supply chain visibility and agility. This includes adopting decentralised models and multi-source procurement strategies to ensure continuity of operations during health crises.\n\nExpert Perspectives on 2025 Risk Mitigation\n\nThe World Economic Forum report emphasises the need for decision-makers to balance current crises with longer-term priorities to navigate these complex risks effectively. Logistics experts seem to align on this, with James Hookham, director of the Global Shippers Forum, advising and equipping his members with tools to best cope with today's geopolitical realities. He finds it helpful to categorise disruption and uncertainty into distinct areas for better management. He identifies these areas as:\n\nGeopolitical events\n\nNatural disasters\n\nClimate change\n\nIndustrial action and labour disputes\n\nThe Red Sea crisis\n\nMedical pandemics\n\nTechnological failures\n\nLocalised disruptions from accidents\n\nGiven the increased frequency of these disruptions, Hookham endorses a new mindset: businesses should think and manage their supply chains as being constantly under crisis, rather than hoping the geopolitics of the moment are temporary.\n\nZera Zheng, Maersk Global Head of Business Resilience Consulting, also sees these issues as the top concern for 2025. Whether it is civil unrest in Mozambique causing damage to the port in Maputo, the outcome of federal elections in Germany, or the impact of tariffs across the globe, Zheng predicts these forces will shape the entire world. This makes it even more important to businesses to ensure they have appropriate channels to receive information and make informed decisions during dynamic times. Zheng says businesses need to know whether and when to activate their contingency plans. Information about global challenges should support in these decisions. She advocates for businesses to be proactive, rather than reactive in a crisis. Every second counts in a crisis, says Zheng. Strategic planning and business continuity exercises will save businesses money and time when it is time to activate a contingency plan.\n\nLooking Ahead and Staying Ready\n\nThe geopolitical landscape in 2025 presents a myriad of challenges that significantly impact supply chains and logistics. From escalating conflicts and trade tensions to climate change, technological vulnerabilities, resource scarcity, regulatory changes, and health crises, businesses must navigate a complex and dynamic environment.\n\nBy all predictions, 2025 will be a turbulent year. Logistics professionals should be ready for multi-faceted solutions that can offer them the flexibility and agility needed to mitigate challenges and ensure resilience in their supply chain operations.\n\nBe ready for geopolitical disruptions to go all the way!

      "title": "Breaking Down the US-Ukraine Critical Minerals Agreement",
      "content": "The US-Ukraine critical minerals agreement, reportedly agreed to on February 25, marks a pivotal moment in economic cooperation between the two states. At its core, the deal aims to unlock Ukraine\u2019s vast mineral reserves and help the United States diversify its critical minerals supply chain, reducing dependence on China. Central to this agreement is the establishment of a joint Reconstruction Investment Fund, designed to funnel revenues from Ukraine\u2019s state-owned mineral resources into economic rebuilding efforts. Yet despite its promising scope, the deal faces significant economic, logistical, and security hurdles that could hinder its impact.\n\nOutdated Data on Mineral Reserves\n\nOne of the most pressing issues is the lack of up-to-date assessments of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth and critical mineral reserves. Most current estimates rely on Soviet-era geological surveys conducted between 30 and 60 years ago. Since then, there has been little modern exploration, leaving significant uncertainty regarding the actual volume and commercial viability of these deposits. Modern mining operations require high-resolution geological mapping, advanced remote sensing technology, and up-to-date resource estimates to attract investors and ensure profitability. Furthermore, due to the ongoing war, some critical mineral data remains classified, limiting accessibility to comprehensive evaluations. This information gap presents a major obstacle for investors who require reliable geological data before committing substantial capital to mining projects.\n\nChallenges Ahead\n\nDamaged Infrastructure and Energy Shortages\n\nYears of armed conflict have taken a heavy toll on Ukraine\u2019s industrial and energy infrastructure. Russian attacks have severely damaged key power generation facilities, and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\u2014the largest in Europe\u2014remains under Russian control. The country\u2019s coal production has also plummeted due to the destruction and flooding of numerous mines. These energy shortages make large-scale mining operations nearly impossible without extensive infrastructure rebuilding. Moreover, the damage extends beyond just power generation: railways, roads, and ports crucial for transporting minerals have also been significantly affected, making logistics an additional concern. Even if mining projects were launched, ensuring a stable electricity supply for refining and processing would be another major challenge.\n\nSecurity and Access Issues\n\nAnother major hurdle is access to Ukraine\u2019s mineral-rich areas. Currently, more than 50% of the country\u2019s mineral deposits are under Russian control. Beyond this, Ukraine is now considered the most heavily mined country in the world, with an estimated 25% of its land at risk from unexploded ordnance. These security threats pose serious risks for both domestic and foreign investors looking to engage in mineral extraction and transportation. Landmine contamination, in particular, presents operational hazards that require extensive demining efforts before safe extraction can take place. The costs of securing mining sites and transport routes could significantly increase operational expenses, making investment in these regions less attractive. Without a definitive resolution to Ukraine war and significant demining efforts, safe and efficient operations are anything but assured.\n\nSteep Costs and Long Payback Periods\n\nMining is an incredibly capital-intensive industry, and Ukraine is no exception. Developing a single mine can cost up to $4 million, while larger projects, such as coking coal plants, can require investments upwards of $10 billion. These costs include geological surveys, obtaining permits, construction of mining infrastructure, procurement of specialized equipment, and workforce training. Additionally, mining projects take a long time to generate returns. According to Ernst & Young, the average timeline from securing a mining license to achieving full-scale production is around 18 years. Factors such as fluctuating global commodity prices, regulatory challenges, and geopolitical risk further complicate the investment landscape. In a country facing ongoing conflict and economic instability, securing long-term investor confidence will be a challenge.\n\nProcessing and Refining Bottlenecks\n\nEven if Ukraine successfully extracts its critical minerals, processing them remains a major issue. Currently, China dominates global mineral refining, particularly for rare earth elements. The refining process involves complex chemical treatments, requiring highly specialized facilities and strict environmental regulations. Without sufficient domestic refining capacity, Ukraine (and by extension, the United States) may still need to rely on China for processing, undermining the strategic intent of the agreement. Establishing local refining capacity would demand billions in additional investment, long-term infrastructure development, and access to advanced technology. Additionally, skilled labor shortages and regulatory challenges could further delay efforts to expand domestic refining capabilities. Even with significant investment, it could take years, if not decades, for Ukraine to build a self-sufficient mineral refining industry capable of competing with global players.\n\nLimited Immediate Financial Returns\n\nGiven the logistical, security, and economic constraints, the US-Ukraine minerals deal is unlikely to yield significant financial returns in the near future. The deal is more of a diplomatic and political maneuver than an immediate economic windfall. The agreement primarily aims to influence negotiations with the Kremlin by outlining the United States\u2019 long-term plans for Ukraine, potentially strengthening Washington\u2019s leverage while also reassuring Americans that involvement in Ukraine yields tangible benefits. However, substantial production and revenue generation are unlikely in the short or medium term. While the long-term prospects appear promising, the agreement remains more symbolic than practical at this stage.\n\nGeopolitical Implications\n\nImpact on US-Russia Relations\n\nRussia could well perceive increased US economic involvement in Ukraine as a direct challenge. By securing mineral rights and establishing financial footholds, the U.S. signals a long-term commitment, potentially complicating negotiations with Moscow. Washington is giving the impression that it is ready to continue supporting Ukraine and hold out for better terms, potentially pressuring the Kremlin into making greater concessions. Yet Russia may persist in its aggression, unwilling to accept anything less than its original demands, convinced that time and the balance of power are in its favor.\n\nOn the other hand, the minerals deal could shape a future in which Russia, through negotiations with the U.S., ultimately acknowledges that Ukraine lies partly outside its sphere of influence, as long as it does not significantly remilitarize or join NATO. Russia has already taken steps to tighten its grip on mineral-rich areas in occupied Ukrainian territories, integrating them into its own industrial and economic networks. Likewise, the United States is leveraging the minerals deal to bind Kyiv into a subordinate position, without extending Washington\u2019s security guarantees. This could be seen as, if not a de jure, then at least a de facto division of Ukraine between the two great powers, with Kyiv clearly at a disadvantage.\n\nEuropean Security and the US Role\n\nWhile Ukraine has actively sought security guarantees from its Western allies, this deal does not include direct military commitments from the United States. Instead, European nations, particularly France and the UK, have proposed deploying peacekeeping forces after the war. However, Russia has firmly opposed any NATO-aligned military presence in Ukraine, making this proposal highly contentious.\n\nThe lack of firm security assurances in the minerals deal means Ukraine will still need to seek additional military support through separate agreements. The European Union has expressed interest in further integrating Ukraine into its economic and security frameworks, but concrete defense commitments remain limited. NATO members have offered military aid and training but have stopped short of guaranteeing direct military intervention, leaving Ukraine in a precarious security position.\n\nDespite the rhetoric and potential economic benefits, Europe remains cautious about direct military involvement in Ukraine. Even if Russia allows European peacekeepers, planning and deploying them would be a daunting task. If that alone sparks disagreements among member states, extending substantial security guarantees without US participation would be even more challenging. Thus, the security environment in which the minerals agreement takes effect may be less than ideal.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Economic Future: Boom or Bind?\n\nReconstruction Investment Fund and US Economic Role\n\nA key feature of the deal is the establishment of a joint Reconstruction Investment Fund, in which Ukraine will allocate 50% of future revenues from state-owned natural resources. This fund is intended to attract Western investors and support economic recovery by providing a structured mechanism for reinvestment into infrastructure, industrial development, and energy projects. Additionally, it is expected to facilitate partnerships between Ukrainian enterprises and international firms, ensuring long-term economic sustainability. However, it also ties Ukraine into a long-term financial arrangement with the United States, potentially limiting its flexibility in future negotiations with other global partners.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Limited Bargaining Power\n\nUkraine remains highly dependent on Western financial and military assistance, limiting its ability to negotiate on equal footing. While its critical minerals offer valuable economic potential, they do not provide enough leverage to dictate favorable terms. The complexities of post-war reconstruction require Ukraine to navigate a delicate balance between attracting foreign investment and maintaining national autonomy. Given the current geopolitical climate, there is growing concern that Ukraine may be forced into economic agreements that primarily benefit its allies rather than ensuring equitable growth and self-sufficiency in the long term.",

      "title": "OT/ICS cyber threats escalate as geopolitical conflicts intensify",
      "content": "Ransomware attacks against industrial organizations surged by 87% over the past year, while new malware families designed specifically for OT environments emerged. These findings highlight a troubling trend: OT systems are increasingly becoming mainstream targets, and even sophisticated threat actors use relatively unsophisticated tactics to infiltrate and disrupt industrial operations.\n\nState-sponsored groups embed themselves in critical infrastructure, while hacktivists and cybercriminals exploit known vulnerabilities, weak remote access configurations, and exposed OT assets. A persistent lack of visibility into OT environments continues to obscure the full scale of these attacks. These insights come from Dragos\u2019 2025 OT/ICS Cybersecurity Report, its eighth annual Year in Review, which analyzes industrial organizations\u2019 cyber threats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen organizations implement stronger network segmentation, improve visibility into their OT environments, and develop more robust incident response capabilities. These proactive measures are making it harder for adversaries to operate undetected and are key to the long-term resilience of industrial cybersecurity,\u201d said Robert M. Lee, CEO of Dragos.\n\nGRAPHITE and BAUXITE OT cyber threat groups\n\nBAUXITE has been implicated in multiple global campaigns targeting industrial entities and specific devices. This group shares substantial technical overlaps, based on capabilities and network infrastructure, with the hacktivist persona CyberAv3ngers, which has explicit affiliations with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2014Cyber and Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), as reported by the U.S. Government.\n\nSince late 2023, Dragos observed four BAUXITE campaigns, including those with Stage 2 ICS Cyber Kill Chain impacts via trivial compromises of exposed devices. Confirmed victims of BAUXITE are in the United States, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East in multiple critical infrastructure sectors, including energy (oil and natural gas, and electric), water and wastewater, food and beverage, and chemical manufacturing.\n\nGRAPHITE targets entities in the energy, oil and gas, logistics, and government sectors across Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The group has strong technical overlaps with APT28 and other names. GRAPHITE focuses on organizations with relevance to the military situation in Ukraine. Observable since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, this focus may indicate a specialized subunit or an expansion of mission goals.\n\nGRAPHITE has been identified conducting spear-phishing campaigns targeting hydroelectric generation and natural gas pipeline operators and facilities and near-constant phishing operations using known vulnerabilities and custom script-based malware to target organizations in critical industries across its targeted geography.\n\nICS-focused malware threats: Fuxnet and FrostyGoop\n\nThe development of new malware strains specifically targeting industrial control systems (ICS) underscores an increasing adversarial focus on disrupting industrial operations.\n\nFuxnet: This malware, attributed to a pro-Ukraine hacktivist group BlackJack, is designed to target industrial sensor networks for Moskollektor, a municipal organization that maintains Moscow\u2019s communication system for a gas, water, and sewage network. Using the Fuxnet malware, BlackJack claimed to disable thousands of sensors and destroy sensor gateway devices, rendering them unable to transmit information.\n\nFrostyGoop: First identified in early 2024, FrostyGoop is a more destructive malware designed to manipulate Modbus TCP/502 communications within ICS environments. It can alter or spoof normal industrial process commands, enabling it to evade antivirus software and cause physical damage to infrastructure, as seen in its documented attack on the energy supply for district heating systems in Ukraine. The malware caused heating outages for over 600 apartment buildings in Ukraine in January 2024. Dragos\u2019s investigation of FrostyGoop revealed that there were over 46,000 internet-exposed ICS devices communicating over Modbus worldwide.\n\nUpdated threat group activity\n\nVOLTZITE is arguably the most crucial threat group to track in critical infrastructure. Due to its dedicated focus on OT data, the group is a capable threat to ICS asset owners and operators. This group shares extensive technical overlaps with the Volt Typhoon threat group tracked by other organizations. It utilizes the same techniques as in previous years, setting up complex chains of network infrastructure to target, compromise, and steal compromising OT-relevant data\u2014GIS data, OT network diagrams, OT operating instructions, etc.\u2014from victim ICS organizations. VOLTZITE is a key reason for monitoring OT networks and hunting for malicious activity. With careful monitoring and investigation of \u201codd\u201d network communication, VOLTZITE can be identified and defended against.\n\nKAMACITE shifted from solely targeting Ukraine by introducing new, custom Windows-based malware strains and expanded its focus to European oil and natural gas (ONG) entities. This coincided with the expiration of an agreement allowing Russian state-owned company Gazprom to supply gas to Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nELECTRUM continues wiper campaigns with a new capability, AcidPour, a binary compiled for Linux operating systems that can search and wipe Unsorted Block Images (UBI) directories in embedded devices, including devices in OT environments. AcidPour is a variant of AcidRain but with extended capability to Memory Technology Devices (MTDs) often found in embedded systems. Dragos determined ELECTRUM used the resources and reputation of the hacktivist persona Solnetspek to obfuscate its operational activities in the December 2023 cyber attack on Kyivstar, Ukraine\u2019s primary telecommunications provider.\n\nOther key findings\n\nGeopolitical conflicts fuel OT-centric cyber operations: Adversaries aligned with state-backed initiatives continued to launch cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure in Ukraine, Russia, and the Middle East, often as a direct extension of military conflicts.\n\nAdversaries aligned with state-backed initiatives continued to launch cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure in Ukraine, Russia, and the Middle East, often as a direct extension of military conflicts. Hacktivist groups escalate attacks on critical infrastructure: Hacktivists leveraged new attack vectors to target OT environments, disrupting energy and water utilities while aligning their actions with geopolitical motivations. In 2023 and into early 2024, Dragos observed a trend of hacktivist groups, or self-proclaimed hacktivist groups, actively targeting and achieving Stage 2 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain against industrial organizations and critical infrastructure and services worldwide.\n\nHacktivists leveraged new attack vectors to target OT environments, disrupting energy and water utilities while aligning their actions with geopolitical motivations.

State-sponsored threat actors and hacktivism converge: Increasing collaboration between hacktivist groups and state-backed cyber actors has led to a hybrid threat model where hacktivists amplify state objectives, either directly or through shared infrastructure and intelligence. State actors increasingly look to exploit hacktivist groups as proxies to conduct deniable cyber operations, allowing for more aggressive attacks with reduced attribution risks.\n\nIncreasing collaboration between hacktivist groups and state-backed cyber actors has led to a hybrid threat model where hacktivists amplify state objectives, either directly or through shared infrastructure and intelligence.

Three notable hacktivist groups were actively using ransomware within their operations in 2024: Handala, Kill Security, and CyberVolk. Ransomware activity surges: The number of ransomware groups targeting industrial organizations jumped to 80, a 60% increase from the 50 groups observed in 2023. Collectively, these groups attacked an average of 34 industrial organizations per week during the first half of 2024. That number more than doubled during the second half of the year. Manufacturing remains the most affected sector, accounting for more than 50% of observed ransomware victims. 25% of the ransomware cases Dragos observed involved full shutdown of an OT site, and 75% involved disruption to operations to some degree.\n\nThe number of ransomware groups targeting industrial organizations jumped to 80, a 60% increase from the 50 groups observed in 2023.

The data from this year\u2019s report is clear: organizations that take proactive security measures experience shorter recovery times, reduced financial losses, and minimized operational disruptions. Threat hunting is no longer an option\u2014it is a necessity.\n\nIndustrial organizations must move beyond reactive security measures and embrace threat hunting as a fundamental defense strategy. Attackers are exploiting known vulnerabilities, remote access weaknesses, and supply chain gaps at an accelerating rate. Organizations that proactively search for threats and adversarial activity within their environments gain a crucial advantage in preventing attacks before they escalate.\n\nICS defenders must be relentless. Attackers like VOLTZITE are already inside networks, and the ability to hunt them down before they cause damage is the next evolution of industrial cybersecurity. Now, more than ever, it\u2019s time to hunt.",

      "title": "Trump's Mineral Deal With Ukraine Reshapes Geopolitical Landscape",
      "content": "Trump's Mineral Deal With Ukraine Reshapes Geopolitical Landscape The agreement grants U.S. access to Ukraine's mineral wealth amid rising tensions with Russia.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump recently finalized a mineral agreement with Ukraine, which is set to reshape both nations' economic and geopolitical landscapes. The deal grants U.S. access to Ukraine's expansive mineral wealth, which includes significant deposits of lithium, rare earth elements, and other valuable resources, positioning the U.S. as potentially one of Ukraine's most significant partners. This development arrives amid heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine, making it especially controversial as Russia's narrative around the situation quickly adapts.\n\nThe agreement, signed during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Washington, marks the culmination of discussions aimed at deepening economic ties and enhancing security cooperation between the two countries. Zelenskyy emphasized how the arrangement enables Ukraine to leverage its rich natural resources, stating, \"This partnership will not only boost our economy but also bolster Ukraine's security against external threats.\" This collaboration offers Ukraine much-needed revenue streams, especially as it faces economic challenges exacerbated by the Russian conflict.\n\nThe stakes of this partnership are underscored by the considerable mineral resources at Ukraine's disposal, particularly lithium, which is integral to the production of batteries for electric vehicles and various electronic devices. Ukraine holds some of the most promising lithium deposits globally, setting the stage for American companies to install production facilities and supply chains within Ukraine. This move is expected to stimulate local economies, create jobs, and potentially provide Ukraine with financial independence from external actors.\n\nInterestingly, Russia's state-controlled media has been rapidly adapting its messages to counter this development. Outlets have characterized the agreement as yet another example of Western imperialism and accused Ukraine of yielding its sovereignty to U.S. interests. Russian officials have claimed this deal undermines Ukrainian independence. According to Russian media analyst Maria Ivanova, \"This agreement not only compromises Ukraine's autonomy but also serves U.S. interests first and foremost. It shows the West's willingness to exploit Ukraine's resources at the expense of its people.\" Such commentary is part of Moscow's broader strategy to frame Ukraine as merely a pawn for Western powers.\n\nPolitical analysts believe the deal could also drive geopolitical wedges between Ukraine and Russia. The reaction from Russian pundits has included ominous warnings about the ramifications of this mineral deal. Former Russian MP Vladimir Zhirinovsky lamented, \"Ukraine is selling off its identity for foreign gold, jeopardizing its future for quick gains.\u201d The Kremlin has often sought to highlight domestic resentment toward Western influence, leveraging fears about economic exploitation as part of its narrative.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. officials are advocating for this partnership as not only beneficial for economic reasons but also as part of broader security strategies against Russian aggression. The U.S. has consistently attempted to bolster Ukraine against what many see as Russian expansionism. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin noted, \"We aim to help Ukraine stand firm against any form of pressure from Moscow.\" These sentiments echo throughout the Biden administration as they voice strong support for Ukraine, especially against the backdrop of recent military conflicts.\n\nThis agreement also aligns with broader U.S. objectives to decrease reliance on China for rare earth materials, which have become increasingly significant as global demand for tech and electric vehicles rises. By investing in Ukraine's resource extraction, the U.S. aims to create more resilient supply chains and mitigate dependency on geopolitical rivals.\n\nCritics, including some U.S. lawmakers, urge caution, pointing to potential pitfalls of overstepping influence within Ukraine. They highlight the need for sustained U.S. support, ensuring such agreements do not lead to overreaches or economic dependency as seen with other nations. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene remarked, \"We must tread lightly, ensuring Ukraine remains sovereign and not just another pawn for U.S. interests to exploit.\u201d These concerns echo sentiments espoused within the American populace, who are wary of foreign entanglements.\n\nAnalysis of the American public\u2019s sentiment reflects increasing interest and support for Ukraine's sovereign right to develop its resources, intertwined with skepticism toward international interventions. Polls indicate varying degrees of approval, with recent surveys showing nearly 65% of voters supportive of strategic partnerships with Ukraine but cautious about military involvement.\n\nEnvironmentalists are also watching closely as these developments raise questions about resource extraction impacts on Ukraine's environment. Experts are wary of the balance required between economic development and ecological preservation, particularly concerning lithium extraction, which carries significant environmental concerns. Advocacy groups like Earth Guardians issued statements urging responsibility to protect Ukraine's biodiversity, highlighting the importance of sustainable practices.\n\nMoving forward, the mineral deal's success will rely heavily on how effectively both countries can navigate the economic, political, and environmental challenges combined. The world will undoubtedly keep its eyes on Ukraine as it embarks on this new chapter, eager to see whether this partnership empowers its sovereignty or entangles it within the global power play between major nations.\n\nUkraine\u2019s upcoming years will be instrumental as the nation grapples with its identity amid significant external pressures. This mineral deal has laid the groundwork for potential economic transformation, yet Ukraine must remain vigilant against possible outcomes steering it away from its democratic aspirations. Both allies and adversaries are well aware; the success of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal will resonate far beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders, signaling either the triumph of independence or tethering to external powers.",

      "title": "Gold shines brighter as stock markets bleed; gains over 9% in 4 months amid global uncertainties",
      "content": "With bears pulling the stock market in a tight embrace, the lure of gold\u2019s sparkle is at its brightest best. At a time when markets are reeling under a major sell-off spell and grappling with significant downward corrections, the yellow metal has been glittering like never before, reinforcing its reputation as a safe-haven asset. On Friday, the stock market witnessed another bloodbath, with the benchmark Nifty50 index crashing nearly 2 per cent. The cuts are even deeper in mid- and small-cap indices.\n\nConsider this: Gold has gained over 9.2 per cent in the last four months, while the Nifty has lost around 15.6 per cent. In 2024, domestic gold prices surged by over 23 per cent, outpacing the Nifty, which gained nearly 9 per cent last calendar year. And over past 12 months, the domestic price of the gold 999 variety has jumped almost 37 per cent to Rs 85,114 per 10 grams (on Friday, February 28, 2025) from Rs 62,135 on February 28, 2024, per data from the Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA). On the other hand, Nifty has gained just under 1 per cent over the past 12 months.\n\nGold is the most globalised commodity and the surge in its prices, too, is a global phenomenon. The major factors behind this jaw-dropping price rally are also global\u2014inflationary concerns, apprehensions over international trade wars and economic fragmentation, geopolitical tensions, and stock market volatility. All these factors feed uncertainty, and as a safe-haven asset, gold shimmers best in times of uncertainty. Put simply, a safe-haven asset is a financial instrument that is highly likely to retain its value or even appreciate in times of economic uncertainty and downturn. Story continues below this ad Also Read | How Trump\u2019s \u2018Gold Card\u2019 US visa could work, what concerns it raises \u201cGrowing concerns about US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff plans have continued to provide some support to the precious metal apart from softish US yields,\u201d said Sandip Raichura, CEO of Retail Broking and Distribution, PL Broking and Distribution. Market watchers feel that while tariff imposition will lead to inflation, gold is a known asset class that has historically preserved its value against inflation, prompting investors to move towards it. According to analysts, given the current global geopolitical and economic uncertainty, gold continues to be a dependable safe-haven asset. \u201cNormally, when stocks and real estate prices fall, investors turn to gold,\u201d said an analyst. Heavy gold purchases by central banks of various emerging market economies, including India, China, Russia, and Turkey, over the past several months have been a key driver of prices of this most crucial reserve asset globally. Also Read | Why are the stock markets falling? No, Trump\u2019s tariffs are not to blame Central banks have been stepping up gold purchases primarily to diversify foreign exchange reserves and mitigate risks emanating for currency volatility. And the trend could continue in the foreseeable future fuelled by evident efforts in various parts of the world towards de-dollarisation, which essentially refers to countries lowering their reliance on the US dollar as the reserve currency and medium of exchange. Story continues below this ad Another factor that fed into the gold price rally were the interest rate cuts in Western economies, particularly the US, last year. Gold becomes quite attractive for investors in low interest rate environments, and unsurprisingly, the precious metal has seen significant inflows over the past year. Similarly, ongoing geopolitical conflicts and a looming international trade war have added to gold\u2019s sheen as the globally most trusted safe-haven asset.",

      "title": "Arctic Showdown: Global Power Struggles & ASEAN\u2019s Stake in the Ice",
      "content": "Historical Context and Evolution of Arctic Geopolitics\n\nAs the Arctic ice melts at an unprecedented rate, a new geopolitical chessboard emerges at the top of the world, drawing global powers into a strategic rivalry that could redefine international power dynamics. With the rapid melting of ice caps due to climate change, the region now offers unprecedented opportunities for resource extraction and maritime navigation, attracting significant interest from global powers. The opening of new shipping lanes, such as the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage, and the vast reserves of hydrocarbons and minerals beneath the Arctic seabed have intensified competition among key players, including the United States, Russia, China, and European Arctic nations. This essay provides an in-depth analysis of the geopolitical rivalry in the Arctic, detailing chronological events, strategic interests, and power dynamics. It also examines the implications of this rivalry for Southeast Asia, particularly the ASEAN region, in terms of energy security, economic shifts, and strategic alliances.\n\nThe geopolitical significance of the Arctic is not a recent phenomenon. During the Cold War, the Arctic served as a strategic buffer zone between the United States and the Soviet Union, with both superpowers maintaining military bases and deploying nuclear submarines in the region. The end of the Cold War brought a period of relative stability, marked by international cooperation on environmental and scientific research through platforms like the Arctic Council. However, the onset of climate change and the resulting ice melt in the early 21st century revitalized interest in the Arctic, transforming it into a contested geopolitical arena.\n\nChronology of Escalations and Strategic Maneuvers\n\nAugust 2007: Russia plants a flag on the seabed beneath the North Pole, symbolically asserting its territorial claims under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This act triggers diplomatic tensions with Canada, Denmark, and Norway, who also have competing claims over the Lomonosov Ridge. 2014: Following the annexation of Crimea, Russia accelerates its military buildup in the Arctic, reopening Soviet-era bases and deploying advanced air defense systems. This move heightens security concerns among NATO member states, particularly Norway and Denmark. October 2023: The Pituffik Space Base in Greenland gains strategic importance as a missile early warning site for the United States, underscoring Greenland\u2019s significance in global security dynamics. January 2024: Denmark announces a $2.05 billion defense budget to bolster its military presence in the Arctic, reflecting growing international interest in Greenland\u2019s strategic location. May 2024: Russia announces the discovery of 511 billion barrels of oil in Antarctica, raising global apprehensions about potential resource exploitation in polar regions. January 2025: Denmark outlines an ambitious plan to modernize its military capabilities in Greenland, including naval expansions and enhanced satellite surveillance, in response to rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nStrategic Interests and Actors in the Arctic Rivalry\n\nThe Arctic region has emerged as a vital strategic arena due to its vast reserves of hydrocarbons, minerals, and fish stocks, along with new maritime routes that significantly reduce shipping times between Asia, Europe, and North America. As the ice melts, geopolitical ambitions intensify, with states seeking to secure their national interests while preventing rival powers from gaining strategic advantages.\n\nFor the United States, the Arctic is not only about resource extraction but also about safeguarding national security interests. The U.S. recognizes the strategic value of Alaska, which grants it direct access to the Arctic Ocean and serves as a crucial military outpost for monitoring Russian activities. Additionally, the U.S. aims to ensure freedom of navigation in the Arctic\u2019s emerging shipping routes to counter Chinese and Russian territorial ambitions.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, regards the Arctic as a strategic lifeline, essential for its economic prosperity and military security. Approximately 20% of Russia\u2019s GDP and 30% of its exports come from Arctic resources. The Northern Sea Route (NSR) is a central pillar of Moscow\u2019s strategy, as it provides a shorter maritime link between Europe and Asia, potentially transforming Russia into a global maritime power. Russia has heavily militarized the region, deploying advanced missile systems, building nuclear-powered icebreakers, and modernizing its Arctic bases to assert control over the NSR and protect its resource interests.\n\nChina\u2019s Arctic policy is driven by its strategic ambition to secure energy resources and diversify trade routes. Labeling itself as a \u201cnear-Arctic state,\u201d China views the Arctic as an extension of its Belt and Road Initiative through the \u201cPolar Silk Road.\u201d This route would allow China to bypass traditional chokepoints like the Malacca Strait, reducing dependency on U.S.-controlled sea lanes. China\u2019s scientific research, infrastructure investments, and partnerships with Nordic countries reveal a calculated approach to establishing its presence without direct territorial claims.\n\nDenmark, through its sovereignty over Greenland, plays a crucial role in Arctic geopolitics. Greenland\u2019s location is of immense strategic importance for military surveillance and missile defense systems, particularly for the U.S. and NATO. Moreover, the potential for resource exploitation in Greenland, including rare earth minerals, positions Denmark as a pivotal player balancing economic ambitions with geopolitical alignments within the Western security architecture. The strategic interests of these actors are deeply intertwined, driving competition and cooperation shaped by national security imperatives, economic aspirations, and environmental concerns.\n\nTheoretical Perspectives on Arctic Geopolitics\n\nTo understand the complex geopolitical dynamics in the Arctic, it is essential to examine them through multiple theoretical lenses. These frameworks help elucidate the motivations and strategic calculations of the key actors involved.\n\nMackinder\u2019s Heartland Theory posits that the control of strategic geographic pivots determines global power. In the context of the Arctic, dominance over the region translates to control over crucial shipping lanes, resource reserves, and military outposts, influencing global power balances. Russia\u2019s expansive Arctic strategy resonates with this theory as it seeks to leverage its geographical advantage to project power and counter NATO\u2019s influence.\n\nMahan\u2019s Sea Power Theory emphasizes the importance of naval supremacy and maritime trade routes in achieving geopolitical dominance. The emergence of the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage underscores the significance of Arctic maritime power. The U.S., Russia, and China\u2019s investments in icebreakers, submarines, and naval bases reflect their strategic intent to control these maritime corridors, reinforcing Mahan\u2019s assertion of sea power as a determinant of geopolitical influence.\n\nRealism, as a theoretical perspective, explains the Arctic rivalry through power politics and national interests. States act in pursuit of security and economic gains, leading to competition and conflict. The militarization of the Arctic by Russia and the U.S., alongside China\u2019s strategic investments, exemplifies the realist notion of a zero-sum game where one state\u2019s gain is perceived as another\u2019s loss.\n\nGeoeconomics explores how states use economic tools to achieve geopolitical objectives. In the Arctic, access to hydrocarbons, rare earth minerals, and fish stocks are pivotal economic drivers that shape geopolitical alignments. China\u2019s investments in Arctic infrastructure and scientific research, framed as economic cooperation, are strategic maneuvers to secure resource access and shipping routes.\n\nConstructivism offers insights into how identities, narratives, and perceptions shape geopolitical interactions. The Arctic is constructed as a space of competition or cooperation depending on national identities and historical narratives. Russia\u2019s portrayal of the Arctic as an integral part of its national identity and security complex contrasts with China\u2019s narrative of being a \u2018near-Arctic state\u2019 to legitimize its involvement.\n\nThese theoretical perspectives provide a comprehensive understanding of the strategic rivalries and alliances in the Arctic, highlighting the interplay of geography, power, economics, and identity in shaping the region\u2019s geopolitical landscape.\n\nImplications for ASEAN\n\nThe geopolitical rivalry in the Arctic has far-reaching implications for ASEAN, influencing its economic landscape, strategic security dynamics, and diplomatic relations. As Arctic resource exploitation accelerates, fluctuations in global energy prices could significantly impact ASEAN economies heavily reliant on energy imports, particularly countries like Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. The shift towards Arctic hydrocarbon resources may also alter traditional energy trade patterns, challenging ASEAN\u2019s established supply chains with Middle Eastern and African producers.\n\nFurthermore, the emergence of Arctic shipping routes, notably the Northern Sea Route, has the potential to reshape global maritime trade. This development could reduce the strategic importance of the Strait of Malacca, which currently serves as a crucial chokepoint for international shipping between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. A decline in the Malacca Strait\u2019s significance may affect the economic lifelines of ASEAN nations, particularly Singapore and Malaysia, which rely on maritime trade revenues.\n\nIn terms of strategic security, the intensifying geopolitical rivalry among the U.S., Russia, and China in the Arctic is likely to influence their foreign policy approaches in the Indo-Pacific region. As all three powers are heavily involved in Southeast Asia\u2019s security architecture, their Arctic confrontations could exacerbate existing tensions in the South China Sea, complicating ASEAN\u2019s pursuit of regional stability. China\u2019s growing Arctic ambitions and military advancements may embolden its assertive stance in the South China Sea, challenging ASEAN\u2019s territorial claims and maritime security.\n\nAdditionally, Russia\u2019s increased military presence in the Arctic could lead to greater defense cooperation with China, influencing strategic alignments in Southeast Asia. Conversely, U.S. efforts to counter Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic may translate into strengthened military alliances with ASEAN countries, potentially heightening geopolitical tensions.\n\nDiplomatically, ASEAN\u2019s non-aligned stance will be tested as the geopolitical rivalry in the Arctic influences international power dynamics. Member states may face pressures to align with one of the competing powers, impacting ASEAN\u2019s unity and decision-making processes. This situation could also influence ASEAN\u2019s approach to global governance issues, particularly in forums like the United Nations, where Arctic-related environmental and maritime policies are debated.\n\nOverall, the Arctic geopolitical rivalry poses complex challenges for ASEAN, necessitating strategic foresight, diplomatic agility, and cohesive regional policies to navigate the evolving global order. Moreover, the strategic competition in the Arctic may influence power dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region. The U.S., China, and Russia\u2014key actors in Arctic geopolitics\u2014are also influential stakeholders in Southeast Asia. Their rivalries and alliances in the Arctic could shape their foreign policies and military postures in the South China Sea, directly affecting ASEAN\u2019s security landscape.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Arctic is increasingly becoming a contested space, driven by strategic interests in resource exploitation, maritime control, and military positioning. As global powers continue to assert their influence, the region\u2019s geopolitical dynamics will have far-reaching implications for international security and economic stability. For ASEAN, navigating this complex geopolitical landscape requires strategic foresight, diplomatic agility, and adaptive economic policies to safeguard regional interests.",

      "title": "Market jitters over tariff chatter",
      "content": "Global equities remain under pressure, while the US dollar extends its rebound amid rising risk aversion. Treasury yields are experiencing their worst weekly slide since September.\n\nRecent US economic data has been mixed, with GDP growing at 2.3% but jobless claims hitting a two-month high. Despite signs of slowing momentum, the dollar found support from geopolitical concerns and tariff announcements.\n\nTrump confirmed the implementation of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and hinted at further levies on China. Trump declined to commit to a security backstop for Ukraine, instead prioritizing peace talks with Russia.\n\nTrump is now targeting the EU with potential 25% tariffs, though details remain unclear. Meanwhile, Germany\u2019s incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, signaled no immediate fiscal reforms or military spending increases.\n\nThe ECB is expected to cut rates by 25bps next week to 2.5%, but policymakers remain divided. Some worry about persistent inflation and trade risks, while others highlight weak growth and the risk of missing the 2% inflation target.\n\nThe ECB meeting will be closely watched for guidance on future rate cuts, while the US jobs report will shape expectations for the Fed\u2019s policy path. These events will be crucial in determining currency and market movements in the coming week.\n\nGlobal Macro\n\nRisk-off across the board\n\nThe global equity selloff continues, the US dollar\u2019s rebound is gaining traction and Treasury yields are suffering their worst weekly slide since September. Investors are avoiding risky bets due to Donald Trump ratcheting up tariff threats, which has seen the euro pull back sharply from 2-month highs versus the dollar. Meanwhile, the pound is outperforming most G10 peers bar the dollar and franc this week and is eyeing its highest weekly close in over three years versus the euro.\n\nWeaker data. The trade and geopolitical news flows once again overshadowed what seemed to be a pretty important week for US macro developments. Durable goods, home sales, jobless claims and GDP data sent mixed signals about the state of the world\u2019s largest economy. GDP grew by an annualized 2.3%, while unemployment claims rose to a 2-month high and tumbled for a second consecutive month. Overall, the data continues to point to weaker economic momentum ahead and the dollar would have depreciated against this backdrop would it not have been for the tariff news.\n\nTariff uncertainty. Markets once again reacted to fresh tariff announcements made by the US President. Donald Trump confirmed that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go into effect, while also hinting at potential new levies on China as soon as March. This bolstered the dollar against the Canadian Dollar and Mexican peso. However, the strengthening of the Greenback broadened out to most major currencies as well.\n\nUkraine in focus. Beyond trade, Trump\u2019s refusal to commit to a security backstop in Ukraine added another layer of geopolitical uncertainty. Meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, he reiterated that the focus should first be on securing a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, rather than discussing long-term military commitments.\n\nCommodities lower for now. In the commodities space, oil prices are trading a multi-month lows having lost around 4% this month as Trump\u2019s aggressive moves on trade triggered anxiety at a time when oil traders were already concerned about lackluster consumption in China. Moreover, hopes for a potential Russia-Ukraine peace deal weighed on the market, as lifting Russian sanctions could increase global oil supply. Commodity FX thus remains under pressure with the Aussie and Canadian dollars trading softer.\n\nTrump\u2019s new target. Trump stated he intends to impose duties of 25% on the European Union without giving any further details on whether those would affect all exports from the bloc or only certain products or sectors. Meanwhile, Germany\u2019s incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, ruled out a swift reform of the country\u2019s borrowing limits and said it was too early to determine whether the outgoing parliament could approve a major military spending increase.\n\nCautiously dovish. The ECB remains confident that policy is still restrictive, but the debate over future rate cuts is intensifying as per the meeting minutes released yesterday. A 25bp cut next week to 2.5% is expected, yet officials are divided. Some have shown worries about sticky services inflation and trade risks, while others fear weak growth and missing the 2% inflation target. The neutral rate remains a wildcard, with policymakers questioning its usefulness as a policy guide. Meanwhile, disinflation is on track, but wage growth and energy risks call for caution.\n\nWeek ahead\n\nLitmus test for the US economy\n\nThis week brings a crucial mix of central bank decisions, inflation data, and labor market reports that will shape market sentiment and dictate currency movements. The ECB meeting takes center stage, as investors assess whether policymakers will hint at a timeline for rate cuts. Meanwhile, in the US, the February jobs report will provide key insights into the strength of the labor market and its implications for the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy path.\n\nUS. ISM PMI data will provide key insights into US economic momentum. A weak manufacturing print could raise growth concerns, while the services sector remains crucial for inflation trends. The ADP Employment report will serve as a preview of Friday\u2019s payrolls release, with markets watching closely for any signs of labor market softening. The most critical release of the week, however, will be Nonfarm Payrolls and Unemployment. If job growth slows from the previously weak 143k, expectations for a Fed rate cut could accelerate, putting pressure on the dollar.\n\nEurozone. The spotlight in the Eurozone will be on the European Central Bank\u2019s policy decision, with markets expecting a rate cut that would bring the deposit facility rate down to 2.5% from 2.75%. However, the outlook beyond this move remains uncertain. Policymakers are divided between concerns over sticky services inflation, higher energy costs, and potential U.S. trade tariffs on one side, and sluggish economic growth alongside the risk of missing the 2% inflation target on the other. The latest GDP figures will also provide insight into the region\u2019s economic trajectory.\n\nFX Views\n\nBack to havens as uncertainty prevails\n\nUSD Balancing tariffs and weaker growth. The US dollar index will likely end the week higher, a feat the dollar has only achieved once in the last seven weeks. Overall, US macro data continues to point to weaker economic momentum ahead and the dollar would have depreciated against this backdrop would it not have been for the tariff news boosting the safe haven buck. Conviction around a sustained dollar rally is fading though, as tariff fatigue and growth concerns begin to weigh on sentiment. In fact, the dollar has suffered its biggest monthly loss (-1%) since August 2024 and is negative against most G10 peers year-to-date. Traders remain cautious amidst elevated trade uncertainty and lack of policy clarity and FX markets will remain driven by trade headlines, with the dollar benefiting from renewed tariff bet. But the long-term picture remains far from clear. For a meaningful rebound, dollar bulls will need either stronger US economic data or an escalation in the global trade war. The upcoming Nonfarm Payrolls report will be critical. If job growth slows, expectations for a Fed rate cut could accelerate, pressuring the dollar.\n\nEUR Topped out in short term. The euro has staged a modest appreciation against the US dollar in February, despite having fallen to an over 2-year low earlier in the month. EUR/USD has risen around 4% from near $1.01 to testing the key psychological (and resistance) handle of $1.05, though still six cents below its 5-year average. A cyclically-driven turn in the US dollar has been noteworthy, with soft US economic data disappointing, helping EUR/USD rebound, but hard data remains robust for now. Reports of a possible peace agreement in Ukraine is also seen as providing a modest boost to EU economies, mainly due to higher military spending prompted by increased security fears, plus lower gas prices alleviating energy cost concerns and providing further support to the euro. However, the latest bout of tariff risks in the latter stages of this week saw the euro slide back under $1.04 after failing to break above its 100-day moving average multiple times. Next week, all eyes are on the ECB rate decision. A 25bps cut is expected so attention will be on forward guidance and how officials view the weak growth outlook versus reflation fears.\n\nGBP Snaps 4-month losing streak. After appreciating against just 6% of its global peers in January, the pound\u2019s good fortunes returned as it appreciated against over 70% of its peers in February. This was thanks to some more upbeat UK data, hawkish BoE commentary and the fact the UK is seen as less exposed to Trump\u2019s tariff threats. Due to higher interest rates in the UK relative to other G10 peers though, the pound\u2019s elevated carry status increases its exposure to equity market fluctuations. Hence, this week\u2019s risk aversion has dragged GBP/USD from a fresh 2-month high of $1.27 to under $1.26. However, sterling has also appreciated against all other G10 peers this week bar the franc, in a sign that it may be deemed a tariff-haven of sorts. Indeed, against the euro, the pound has edged up above the \u20ac1.21 resistance level and a weekly close above here would be the highest in three years, with \u20ac1.22 the next upside target. Against the dollar, despite the slide this week, the pound is still primed for an over 1% rise this month, snapping a 4-month losing streak.\n\nCHF Turning to havens. The Swiss franc appreciated against 70% of its global peers in February, up from the mere 20% it rose against the month prior. FX traders are seeking safety in traditional havens like CHF as they look to hedge against potential shocks from trade policy, geopolitics and political uncertainty. This is further evidenced by the fact one-month implied-realized volatility spreads show only franc and yen options are overpriced amongst the G10. However, the franc is vulnerable against the yen as the prospect of a positive carry on the latter currency looms large. Still, CHF/JPY has gained a whopping 55% over the past six years, so a correction lower is long overdue. Against the euro and the pound, the franc is also historically overvalued and has appreciated for two weeks on the trot against the former. However, if talks to end the war in Ukraine show signs of bearing fruit, the franc could come under selling pressure if it spurs risk appetite, though tariff policy remains a key source of uncertainty.\n\nCAD On edge until the last minute? The USD/CAD has rebounded from its weekly low of 1.4182, just above its 20-weekly SMA, reaching a 3-week high of 1.4443\u2014a 261 pips increase\u2014as tariff risk premia rise amidst uncertain trade policy decisions. Contradictory messages about plans to enact tariffs on Canada and Mexico have heightened volatility, especially in the USD/CAD pair, with implied volatility surging as March 4th approaches. A last-minute deadline extension to April 2nd remains possible, but we expect volatility to remain elevated until a formal confirmation is made. The Loonie is targeting important resistance at 1.445 and may maintain upward momentum as nervousness increases and protection against a break above 1.45 puts pressure on it. The 60-day SMA at 1.433 is a crucial support level if tariffs are postponed for another month.\n\nNext week will be filled with macroeconomic data that will provide a better gauge of the US economy, featuring payrolls (Fri) and ISM manufacturing (Mon) as key data points. In Canada, manufacturing (Mon) and the unemployment rate (Fri) will be in focus.\n\nAUD RBA\u2019s communication shift bolsters Aussie resilience. The RBA may stop naming dissenting board members under its new monetary policy committee regime to limit \u201cnoise\u201d around rate decisions. Deputy Governor Hauser expects further positive inflation news but remains cautious given Australia\u2019s tight labor market. The committee will likely present unified views in public speeches moving forward. Technically, AUD/USD shows mixed signals after Cloud rejection on February 21 with easing upward momentum suggesting a potential near-term pullback. However, the broader outlook remains positive with price closed within the Cloud and the falling wedge pattern resolved after reaching 93% of its 0.6421 target. Any pullback should find support at the lower Cloud (around 0.6200). A breakout above the Cloud would expose moves to 0.6545, then 0.6688. Market focus shifts to upcoming current account, retail sales, and GDP data for further directional cues.\n\nJPY Wage demands fuel Yen\u2019s technical breakout. Japan Metal Worker Unions are demanding record pay increases of 14% year-on-year, adding to wage growth momentum that could support BOJ policy normalization. Market pricing for a May BOJ rate increase remains modest at 5.375bp, supported by recent increases in underlying inflation measures. The rising wedge pattern in USD/JPY remains valid with a technical target at 145.50. A head and shoulders top formation on the weekly chart reinforces the negative outlook. Rebounds to Cloud resistance (around 153.74) would be tolerated before reconsidering this view. Chart shows USD/JPY performance over the years from 1975 onwards. USD/JPY returned circa -5% YTD. Markets will closely monitor upcoming unemployment rate, capital spending, monetary base, and household confidence data for additional clues on BOJ policy direction.\n\nCNY Diplomatic tones accelerate Yuan strength. President Xi urged officials to respond calmly to challenges while expanding economic opening, signaling a measured approach to Trump policies. Trump indicated the US-China relationship will be \u201ca very good one,\u201d encouraging bilateral investment, though decoupling concerns persist with looming tariffs and his America First Investment Policy. USD/CNH displays increasing downside bias after closing below the Cloud, though overnight downside exhaustion candlestick with softer downward momentum suggests a potential near-term corrective rebound. The pair remains technically negative below the Cloud with 7.1475 as the next target. Any upside should be rejected around Cloud resistance (approximately 7.3000). A break above the Cloud would weaken negative conviction and expose 7.3682. No significant economic data releases are scheduled, keeping focus on geopolitical developments.\n\nMXN 50bps cuts will continue\n\nBanxico\u2019s latest report supports further monetary easing, citing lower growth forecasts and stable inflation projections.\n\nThe dovish tone suggests additional rate cuts are anticipated. Governor Rodr\u00edguez reiterated that future rate cuts will likely mirror the recent 50 basis point reduction.\n\nBanxico presented different technical research summaries, with an emphasis on the evolution of average and extreme variations in core inflation.\n\nThe inflation study indicates reduced inflationary pressures, aligning core inflation closer to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nEffects of global shocks on inflation have diminished, with most seasonally adjusted price variations returning to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nExtreme variations in core inflation have reached levels below pre-pandemic trends.\n\nThe report reinforces expectations of a 50-basis point rate cut at the next two meetings, bringing the reference rate to 8.50%.\n\nDespite global uncertainties, Banxico remains committed to its rate cut strategy.\n\nThe unresolved tariff threat and the ongoing USMCA renegotiation contribute to elevated market uncertainty.\n\nStructural issues related to USMCA may take time to resolve, maintaining heightened uncertainty.\n\nGradual carry loss is expected to weigh on the Mexican peso (MXN), reducing its capacity to absorb external shocks.\n\nHave a question?

      "title": "EPAM Systems, Inc. SEC 10-K Report",
      "content": "EPAM Systems, Inc., a leading global provider of digital platform engineering and software development services, has released its 2024 10-K report. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance, business operations, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces in the current geopolitical and economic landscape.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nEPAM Systems, Inc. reported revenues of $4,727.94 million for 2024, reflecting a 0.8% increase from the previous year. This growth was positively impacted by acquisitions and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. The cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, amounted to $3,277.50 million, representing 69.3% of total revenues. This increase was driven by higher compensation costs and reduced benefits from hedging activities.\n\nIncome from operations stood at $544.58 million, accounting for 11.5% of revenues, with an increase attributed to higher utilization rates and government incentives. Net income for the year was $454.53 million, representing 9.6% of revenues, with an effective tax rate of 22.2%. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were reported at $7.84, reflecting an improvement due to enhanced financial performance and excess tax benefits from stock-based awards.\n\nBusiness Highlights\n\nIn 2024, Financial Services emerged as the largest revenue segment for EPAM, comprising 21.6% of total revenues. Other segments such as Life Sciences & Healthcare and Emerging Verticals also experienced revenue growth. However, segments like Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel, Business Information & Media, and Software & Hi-Tech saw declines.\n\nGeographically, the Americas region, including North, Central, and South America, accounted for 60.0% of total revenues, showing a 3.4% increase from the previous year. North America specifically saw a 3.7% increase in revenues, driven by acquisitions and higher utilization rates. Conversely, the EMEA region experienced a slight decrease in revenues, and the APAC region's contribution remained minimal.\n\nThe company maintained a high utilization rate of delivery professionals at 76.7% in 2024, reflecting efficient staffing and strategic hiring practices. EPAM continued to expand its service offerings by integrating software engineering with customer experience design, business consulting, and technology innovation services.\n\nLooking ahead, EPAM plans to diversify its client base and expand its service offerings through strategic acquisitions and organic growth. The company aims to reduce revenue concentration from top clients over the long term and maintain high-quality delivery and operational resilience, particularly in response to geopolitical challenges such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nStrategic Initiatives\n\nEPAM completed several strategic acquisitions in 2024, including NEORIS and First Derivative, to enhance its client portfolio and expand its presence in Latin America and Europe. These acquisitions contributed $65.9 million to revenues. The company also focused on the geographic repositioning of its workforce due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, relocating employees to safer locations.\n\nIn terms of capital management, EPAM repurchased $398.0 million of its common stock under its share repurchase programs, including the new 2024 Repurchase Program authorized for up to $500.0 million. The company did not declare or pay any cash dividends, opting instead to retain earnings for business operations and share repurchases. As of December 31, 2024, EPAM had $1.286 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with $675.0 million available under its revolving credit facility.\n\nLooking forward, EPAM plans to continue monitoring the situation in Ukraine and adapt its business continuity plans as necessary. The company expects to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. EPAM also intends to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments to support growth while managing the potential impacts of geopolitical events on its financial condition.\n\nChallenges and Risks\n\nEPAM faces significant geopolitical risks, particularly due to instability in regions where it operates, such as Ukraine and Belarus. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine following Russia's invasion has materially affected operations and could continue to do so, impacting personnel safety, service delivery, and financial results. Additionally, geopolitical instability may necessitate increased expenses and operational shifts, affecting profitability.\n\nOperational risks include the challenge of managing growth and maintaining productivity amid fluctuating client demand and economic conditions. The company must effectively recruit, train, and retain skilled professionals to meet client needs, which is complicated by intense competition for talent and wage inflation in emerging markets.\n\nThe rapid adoption of generative AI presents both opportunities and risks. EPAM must integrate AI technologies effectively to remain competitive, as clients increasingly expect AI-driven solutions. Failure to do so could result in reduced demand for human-delivered services and pressure on pricing.\n\nRegulatory risks are heightened by the need to comply with diverse legal requirements across jurisdictions, including potential changes in tax benefits in countries like Belarus and Poland. The company also faces risks related to data protection regulations, such as GDPR, which impose significant compliance costs and potential penalties for non-compliance.\n\nManagement is actively monitoring geopolitical developments and enhancing security measures to protect personnel and infrastructure. EPAM is also investing in AI capabilities and expanding its global delivery model to mitigate risks associated with geopolitical instability and competitive pressures. The company is exposed to market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could adversely affect financial results. The hedging program is subject to counterparty default risk, which could result in significant losses during economic downturns.\n\nSEC Filing: EPAM Systems, Inc. [ EPAM ] - 10-K - Feb. 27, 2025",

      "title": "Poland\u2019s Immaculate Rise to Europe\u2019s Military and Technological Powerhouse",
      "content": "Against the backdrop of rising threats in Eastern Europe, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Poland has stepped up and taken a leading role in countering Russia\u2019s aggression on the continent.\n\nKnowing the horrors of being under Moscow\u2019s thumb, Warsaw is not only conducting Major remilitarization but is also becoming a major economic and technological hub in Europe. Poland\u2019s immaculate rise started from its unbreakable spirit amidst the horrors of WWII and communist rule, and the country\u2019s continued growth is an example on the continent, the NATO mutual defense alliance, and Earth in general.\n\nPoland\u2019s Remilitarization Efforts\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves around the world; though some countries have been hesitant to adapt to the new geopolitical realities, Poland refused to sit and stand idly. In March 2022, Poland purchased $4.75 billion of Patriot missiles to bolster the nation\u2019s air defense. Later that same year, Warsaw purchased 250 M1 Abrams tanks from the US and 180 K2 tanks from South Korea.\n\nFurthermore, Poland, witnessing the effectiveness of HIMARS against Russian forces, purchased 500 of the revived late Cold War era weapons system. Supplementing combined arms warfare, Warsaw procured 48 FA50 light attack aircraft, 670 K9 howitzers, and 1400 infantry fighting vehicles.\n\nPreparing to dominate the air in Eastern Europe, Poland purchased 32 F-35As, 48 F-16 Block Cs and Ds, and 12 FA-50s from the South Korean manufacturer KAI, bringing its total fleet to 48 of the latter.\n\nA Growing Economic and Technological Hub\n\nPoland was devastated by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and later five decades of communist rule that affected economic and technological growth. Nevertheless, Warsaw transformed their public and private sectors into a major financial and technological hub.\n\nPoland launched its first satellite, the PW-Sat, 2012 and conducted its first artificial heart implant surgery in 2018. Furthermore, Poland is home to 60,000 technology companies.\n\nPoland\u2019s major geographic advantage has enticed investors to invest in programs there. It is close to growing information technology hubs such as Estonia, Lithuania, Czechia, Germany, and Denmark, and its proximity to the Baltic Sea allows companies to push data and innovate around the country easily.\n\nBreaking out of Soviet-backed stagnation, Poland massively transformed its economy\u2014increasing it by over 177% from the end of communism in 1989 to 2007, and it continues to grow. Diversifying the economy, joining the European Union, and the Balcerowicz Plan all played a major role in pushing Warsaw to the forefront of economic growth on the continent.\n\nAn Example of NATO Cooperation and Leadership\n\nPoland is currently amongst the top contributors to defending Ukraine and countering Russian aggression on the continent in both military aid and GDP per capita. As of August 2024, Poland contributed 4.91% of its GDP to Ukraine through economic and military assistance.\n\nOver one-third of the current tanks Ukraine received came from neighboring Poland, which also provided ample amounts of artillery and MiG-29s and is helping the war-battered neighbor train new legions.\n\nConcurrently, Poland is the overall leader in NATO members\u2019 defense spending per GDP. Per the 2% standard that every country in NATO tries to achieve, Poland is the alliance\u2019s top contributor, allocating 4.12% last year and aiming to grow the number to 4.7% of its GDP in 2025.\n\nSharing a border with Russia\u2019s enclave of Kaliningrad, which is capable of using nuclear-tipped missiles, Poland also faces a future existential threat of Russian expansion over neighboring Ukraine. A Russian victory in Ukraine would be catastrophic for not only Poland but much of Europe as countries such as Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia do not have the capabilities to match Russia.\n\nFurthermore, due to past horrors and conflicts faced with Moscow, Warsaw is aware they would be next in the Kremlin\u2019s Neo-Russian Empire ambitions. Building a military is not just to turn itself into a regional power; Poland is also becoming an overall shield for other Eastern European nations and NATO\u2019s current largest European military.\n\nLessons from Poland\n\nWith its growing military capabilities, information technology sector, and rising economic outlook, Warsaw looks to position itself as a major Eastern European soft power player and a future regional power within the NATO alliance. Through several decades of growth, diversifying economic investments, and growing national pride in lieu of rising Russian threats, Poland positions itself never to be caught off guard again, akin to WWII.\n\nKnowing what it\u2019s like to be partitioned, be placed under foreign rule, and face the horrors of Russian oversight over their sovereignty, Poland is showing NATO and the West as a whole not to submit to appeasement and lack of preparation for future full-scale military confrontations.\n\n[Photo by Spc.

      "title": "G20 finance meeting ends without consensus or communique",
      "content": "CAPE TOWN, Feb 27 (Reuters) - South Africa voiced dismay on Thursday that Group of 20 talks it hosted on global economic issues ended without consensus, after top officials from several countries skipped it and delegates remained far apart on issues such as climate finance.\n\nThe two-day G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Cape Town failed to come up with a joint communique. However a \"chair's summary\" issued by the host said participants \"reiterated the commitment to resisting protectionism.\"\n\n\n\nThe summary added they had \"supported a rules-based, non-discriminatory, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, sustainable and transparent multilateral trading system,\" using several words the Trump administration has already strongly objected to.\n\nSouth Africa had hoped to make the G20 a platform for putting pressure on rich countries to do more to tackle climate change, to give more towards poorer countries' transitions to green energy and to reform a financial system that favours investment banks at the expense of poor sovereign debtors.\n\nBut the talks were overshadowed by the absence of several key finance chiefs - such as from the United States, China, India and Japan - and foreign aid cuts by major economies like the United States and Britain, against a backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nSouth African Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said he was \"not happy\" the G20 meeting could not issue a joint communique.\n\n\"I'm not going to (name) ... any specific country, but climate issues are becoming a challenge for the first time,\" he told Reuters after issuing the G20 summary.\n\n\"I think there is a view that we should prioritise other things than necessary climate financing.\"\n\nIn an earlier news conference, he said that though there was a difference of opinion on the way forward on climate action: \"there has been general agreement against protectionism and economic fragmentation.\"\n\nBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda told reporters after the meeting that \"the broader G20 view was that if downside risks like geopolitical tension and supply chain disruptions materialize, that could hamper the G20 goal of achieving sustainable, balanced global growth.\"\n\nG20 countries account for 85% of global gross domestic product and 75% of international trade. The grouping was formed in response to the 1999 Asian financial crisis to improve cooperation in addressing shocks across national borders.\n\nThe chair's summary has become a feature of multilateral meetings in which participants do not reach a formal consensus.\n\nOn the global economy, the summary noted that growth patterns varied across economies and said various risks and trends had been discussed.\n\n\"Inflation has receded, supported by well-calibrated monetary policies and the unwinding of supply shocks, although progress has varied across countries,\" the summary said.\n\n\n\nReporting by Leika Kihara, Kopano Gumbi, Wendell Roelf, Duncan Miriri and Andy Bruce; Additional reporting by Tannur Anders and Sfundo Parakozov; Writing by Tim Cocks and Alexander Winning; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Rod Nickel",

She argued that these reforms must be rooted in democratic principles\u2014a key factor that she says sets the EU apart from other global powers.\n\nGrowing divide in Europe\n\nThe key tension in European politics today, she said, is between Europeanism and nationalism.\n\nWhile most member states support a more unified Europe, she noted that nationalist movements are gaining momentum. She urged mainstream political parties to actively counter these movements.\n\nGonzalez Laya also addressed broader challenges posed by the rise of the far-right and the role of tech companies in undermining democratic systems.\n\nShe highlighted the shared struggles of the EU and the US under the leadership of President Donald Trump, who she believes is contributing to a \"rupture period\" that threatens democratic values around the globe.\n\nFormer NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, who also participated in the discussion, echoed these concerns.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we are going through a bad period for both the EU and the US,\u201d he said, describing Trump as a particularly disruptive figure.\n\nHe expressed apprehension over Trump\u2019s support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has gained significant political influence in Germany.\n\nSolana pointed out that Americans fought and died in the past to oppose the ideologies promoted by the AfD, making Trump\u2019s endorsement of the party even more troubling.\n\nNews.Az",

      "title": "A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve on civil fraud charges",
      "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nA businessman who pumped $75 million into the Trump family-backed crypto token finds himself in a fortunate position this week as federal securities regulators are hitting pause on their civil fraud case against him.\n\nOn Wednesday, lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission and Justin Sun, a 34-year-old Chinese crypto entrepreneur, asked a federal judge to put the agency\u2019s case on hold, citing the interests of both sides and \u201cthe public\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nThe pause is a 180 for the SEC, America\u2019s top financial regulator, which two years ago charged Sun and his companies \u2014 Tron, BitTorrent and Rainberry \u2014 with selling unregistered securities and fraudulently manipulating the price of digital token Tronix. Sun and his companies sought to have the case dismissed.\n\nSun is a polarizing figure within the world of crypto, in which he has become one of the most prominent investors in the World Liberty Financial crypto project, backed by the Trump family. Sun\u2019s $75 million purchase of World Liberty tokens, which he\u2019s touted in social media posts, could set the Trump family up to eventually collect tens of millions of dollars, as the family is entitled to 75% of the tokens\u2019 revenues, according to the company. Sun is also an official adviser to World Liberty, which lists President Donald Trump as its \u201cchief crypto advocate\u201d and his son Barron as its \u201cDeFi visionary.\u201d\n\nWorld Liberty is just one of several crypto projects the president and his family have set up in recent months, raising concerns about potential corruption. By its nature, crypto offers a particularly easy way to, anonymously or otherwise, funnel money into assets that directly benefit the president and his family.\n\n\u201cNow anyone in world can essentially deposit money into bank account of President of USA with a couple clicks,\u201d tweeted Anthony Scaramucci, former Trump White House communications director, after Trump launched a digital token known as a memecoin last month. \u201cEvery favor \u2014 geopolitical, corporate or personal \u2014 is now on sale, right out in the open.\u201d\n\nThe SEC declined to comment. Neither the White House nor Sun responded to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThis is, I guess, going to be the new approach \u2014 hands off crypto, not enforcing fraud \u2026 and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to end well,\u201d Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and an ethics lawyer for the George W. Bush administration, told me. \u201cThe SEC is going to back off \u2014 because that\u2019s what the Trump administration wants \u2014 on whatever enforcement they are able to do. I think it\u2019s a very worrisome situation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a widely expected move, the SEC on Thursday officially dropped its enforcement action against US crypto exchange Coinbase, citing \u201cthe Commission\u2019s ongoing efforts to reform and renew its regulatory approach to the crypto industry.\u201d\n\nCompounding conflicts of interest\n\nThe Sun case comes as the Trump administration appears to be opening the door to potential corruption beyond crypto. Critics across the political spectrum say it\u2019s a troubling trend for a president and a White House that is ditching guardrails at an alarming speed and gutting the government\u2019s ability to combat corruption.\n\nSince returning to office over a month ago, the president has paused all investigations into corporate foreign bribery and fired inspectors general from more than a dozen federal agencies. His Justice Department has moved to suspend its case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, whom prosecutors had accused of soliciting bribes from Turkish nationals (allegations Adams denies). Trump pardoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who spent eight years in prison on multiple corruption charges, including scheming to sell a vacant Senate seat. And earlier this month, Trump said that Elon Musk\u2019s financial disclosures would be kept confidential even as Musk wields power over federal agencies and contracts that directly impact his own business empire.\n\nThe president has also come full circle on crypto, which he once dismissed as a scam.\n\nThat\u2019s been a mixed blessing for the industry, which has been working to shed its well-earned reputation for illicit activities. On one hand, crypto advocates seeking to establish a legitimate regulatory framework have welcomed Trump\u2019s broadly positive rhetoric on digital assets. But Trump\u2019s memecoin ventures \u2014 along with his pardoning of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road criminal enterprise, and the SEC\u2019s heel-turn on its case against Sun \u2014 are the kind of fringe causes that reinforce the industry\u2019s association with bad actors.\n\nWithin crypto, Sun is a polarizing figure. While the Tron community sees him as a visionary, his detractors see him as an opportunist who thrives on hype, said Gareth Rhodes, managing director at advisory firm Pacific Street. \u201cBoth supporters and detractors can agree he wields substantial influence in crypto,\u201d he added.\n\nSun, who garnered headlines last year for his $6.2 million purchase of a banana duct-taped to a wall, is \u201camong the least sympathetic litigants in the industry,\u201d Eric Soufer, a political adviser to major crypto companies, told me Thursday.\n\nThe SEC and Sun\u2019s lawyers, in their letter to the judge, proposed submitting a status report 60 days after a stay, at which point there would likely be more details about the case\u2019s resolution, including any possible settlement.\n\n\u201cObviously his connections to Trump Coin are going to raise questions,\u201d Soufer added. \u201cBut we need to see what the actual settlement looks like before we can judge just how much politics may have played a role.\u201d",

      "content": "Let's face it \u2013 jumping into cryptocurrency for the first time feels like being thrown into the deep end of a pool when you barely know how to swim.\n\nThat's exactly the problem $GINI tokens are trying to solve. I've been keeping an eye on projects that actually remind meof what it's like to be a beginner. $GINI, the native token of the KALP ecosystem, caught my attention precisely because it doesn't assume everyone's a tech wizard or experienced trader.\n\nWhy First-Time Crypto Buyers Might Actually Like $GINI\n\n1) They've Made Buying and Getting Started Way Less Confusing\n\nI still remember my first crypto purchase \u2013 watching YouTube tutorials with one screen while frantically trying to figure out if I was about to lose my money on the other. $GINI has clearly put effort into making this less terrifying through:\n\nSimplified buying options that don't require a computer science degree\n\nStraightforward wallet setup that explains things in plain English\n\nOfficial website distribution system instead of multiple platforms\n\n2) The Price Doesn't Look Like a Heart Attack on a Chart\n\nWhile $GINIisn't immune to crypto market craziness, they've built in some protections against the wild price swings that traumatise new investors:\n\nTheir vesting schedule prevents early investors from dumping millions of tokens the second they can profit.\n\nThe token has actual utility rather than pure speculation, creating more natural demand\n\nThe focus on regulatory compliance attracts a different type of investor, typically less prone to panic selling\n\n3) They Remember That New Investors Need Education\n\nMy biggest complaint when entering crypto was always \"wheredo I learn this stuff?\" $GINI seems to actually care about this through:\n\nBasic education that doesn't assume you already understand blockchain\n\nCommunity forums where beginner questions aren't mocked\n\nStep by Step Tutorials that start from square one instead of halfway through\n\nRegular updates in plain language about what's happening\n\n4) The Community Doesn't Make You Feel Sad for Being New\n\nWe've all seen those crypto communities where asking basic questions gets you laughed out of the Discord server. $GINI has cultivated something different:\n\nCommunity structures that welcome input from smaller holders\n\nOpen community programs connecting veterans with newcomers\n\nAMAs where no question is too basic\n\n5) The Actual Tools Are Built for Humans, Not Robots\n\nI can't overstate how frustrating most crypto interfaces are for beginners. $GINI focuses on:\n\nWallets that explain what you're doing before you do it\n\nClear confirmation steps so you don't accidentally send tokens to the wrong address\n\nHelp resources that are one click away when you're confused\n\nConclusion\n\nFor absolute beginners dipping their toes in the blockchain waters, $GINI offers a middle path \u2013 blockchain innovation without the extreme technical barriers and wild west atmosphere that characterises much of the space.\n\nAs with any investment \u2013 start small and do your research.But if you'redetermined to explore this space, projects like $GINI that actually remember what it's like to be a beginner might just be your best first step.",

      "title": "Bitcoin crashes below $80,000 as Trump\u2019s crypto hype fizzles",
      "content": "Bitcoin has fallen below the psychologically crucial $80,000 mark as the euphoria surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s pro-crypto policies fades, with major digital assets erasing most of their post-election gains.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency is down 21% from its January peak, retreating to levels seen shortly after Trump\u2019s election victory in November. At 01:30 pm IST, Bitcoin was trading 8.2% lower, CoinMarketCap data showed.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies have suffered sharper declines, with Ether losing more than 40% since December. Trump\u2019s own meme coin, launched days before his inauguration despite conflict-of-interest concerns, has plunged 80% from its peak, it further highlighted.\n\nMarket recalibrates expectations\n\nThe market remains subdued as investors await a clear bullish signal\u2014either a Federal Reserve rate cut or concrete pro-crypto regulations from the Trump administration, Reuters reported.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign promises, including establishing a national Bitcoin reserve and easing regulations, sparked an initial rally. However, while his administration has taken steps\u2014such as dropping an SEC lawsuit against Coinbase and halting probes into crypto firms\u2014analysts say these moves have failed to support prices.\n\n\u201cThe market is disappointed,\u201d Reuters quoted James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, as saying. \u201cUntil we get clarity on a Bitcoin reserve, I can't see prices recovering significantly.\u201d\n\nAlso read: India to revisit crypto regulatory framework amid global shifts: DEA Secretary Ajay Seth\n\nGabe Selby, Head of Research at CF Benchmarks, told Reuters, \u201cThe initial excitement surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s perceived pro-crypto stance appears to be in a phase of recalibration. For sentiment to shift decisively, a clearer regulatory framework or a major catalyst\u2014such as further ETF approvals\u2014seems necessary.\u201d\n\nInstitutional sell-off and macroeconomic risks\n\nSince December, nearly $1 trillion in market value has been wiped out, bringing total crypto capitalisation down to $2.76 trillion, CoinMarketCap data shows.\n\nInstitutional investors are playing a key role in the sell-off. News18 reported that asset managers, including BlackRock, have offloaded billions worth of Bitcoin and Ether. However, filings indicate that sovereign wealth funds and banks are still buying, with Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala Investment Co revealing a $436.9 million stake in BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin ETF, Reuters report pointed out.\n\nLitecoin is showing some resilience, with bulls defending the $120 support level, CoinDCX Research told News18.\n\nAdding to market uncertainty is Trump\u2019s trade war. His recent 10% tariff hike on China has dampened appetite for speculative assets. Meanwhile, regulatory clarity may be emerging, with the SEC dropping its lawsuit against Coinbase and ruling that most meme coins do not qualify as securities.\n\nBitcoin had surged past $75,000 on November 6, 2024, following Trump\u2019s election win and a wave of ETF inflows. It peaked at $109,350 in January 2025, before entering its current downturn.\n\nDespite the slump, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick remains bullish, sticking to his prediction that Bitcoin could hit $500,000 before Trump leaves office. His optimism hinges on fresh institutional demand, particularly from sovereign wealth funds and banks, Reuters added.\n\n(With agency inputs)",

Its recent declines accelerated after President Donald Trump yesterday said that tariffs on Mexico and Canada would go into effect on March 4 and an additional 10% in levies would be imposed on China. Investors view tariffs as likely to slow growth and stoke inflation, which could scuttle the chance of interest rate cuts this year and make non-yielding risk-on assets like bitcoin less attractive.\n\nBitcoin is now in bear market territory, having fallen well over 20% from its record high level of around $109,000 set last month. It is currently at levels last hit in October before Trump, seen viewed as a pro-crypto candidate, was reelected. More recently, though, they've come off the sub-$80,000 levels hit overnight.\n\nShares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and Marathon Digital parent company MARA Holdings (MARA) and trading app Robinhood (HOOD) all fell around 1% Friday morning, retracing some of their 2%-3% losses in earlier trading. Bitcoin mining and infrastructure company Riot Platforms (RIOT) is now up 2% after dropping more than 3% in premarket trading.\n\nBusiness intelligence and bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, is down around 0.5%. The company said Monday it had again expanded its bitcoin holdings, acquiring nearly $2 billion more of the digital currency.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, regulators have lately continued to upend Biden-era crypto enforcement. The Securities and Exchange Commission confirmed late Thursday it is recommending the dismissal of a two-year lawsuit against Coinbase days after Robinhood said the regulator had told the trading app operator it wouldn\u2019t face any penalties over its cryptocurrency business.\n\nUPDATE\u2014Feb. 28, 2025: This article has been updated to include refreshed bitcoin and share prices.\n\n",

      "title": "Bitcoin Down 25% From All-Time High as Crypto Rout Worsens",
      "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A week-long rout in Bitcoin deepened amid the recent broader retreat from risky assets in the wake of US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats and crypto sector turmoil, marking a dramatic reality check for one of the most popular Trump trades.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe original cryptocurrency tumbled as much as 7.2% to $78,226 at one point Friday, bringing its decline from the all-time high reached less than six weeks ago to 25%. Bitcoin has since pared the loss, and was trading little changed on the day. The weekly slide has put the digital currency on pace for its worst week since August.\n\n\u201cSome large players just said at the end of the day, \u2018you know what, I\u2019m just going to throw in the towel,\u201d said Zaheer Ebtikar, co-founder of crypto fund Split Capital. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we saw this past week. There was definitely a lot of selling more than usual, so it\u2019s hard to pinpoint one specific exchange or place.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s drop in Bitcoin has taken it to technical levels that many traders watch for signs that the selloff may have gone too far, inspiring dip buyers to step in and at least pause the declines. Bitcoin has fallen below its 200-day moving average, a closely watched indicator of the long-term trend, for the first time since October. Its 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of price momentum, this week fell below a level indicating the asset is considered oversold for the first time since September.\n\nTrump said Thursday that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would come into force from March 4, undermining hopes he might reverse course after a previous delay. He also said Chinese imports would face a further 10% levy, prompting officials in Beijing to promise \u201call necessary measures\u201d in response.\n\nThe focus on trade tensions had led to a broad risk-off decline across markets on Friday, pushing down almost all Asian stock markets and fueling declines in European futures. But cryptocurrencies \u2014 which are deeply exposed to shifts in risk appetite \u2014 were among the worst hit.\n\nBitcoin has now fallen more than 20% in February. If the decline holds through the end of Friday, it would mark the biggest monthly drop since June 2022.\n\nTrump Trade Woes\n\nThe selloff underscores a swift change of fortunes for what was previously one of the most popular Trump trades in global markets: buying Bitcoin on the expectation that the president\u2019s crypto-friendly approach would lead to a broad rally.\n\nStory Continues",

      "title": "Bitcoin dominance of crypto hits four-year high. Here\u2019s what it means for prices",
      "content": "Bitcoin commands 60% of the total crypto market value, its highest in four years.\n\nOnly a small subset of \"altcoins\" will rise in tandem.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have become disillusioned with altcoins,\u201d said Jameson Lopp.\n\nIn rocky markets, spooked investors tend to flock to the safety of gold. In rocky crypto markets, they flock to the crypto version of a haven: Bitcoin.\n\nThose moves have made Bitcoin dominant over the total cryptocurrency market \u2014 the top crypto now takes up more than 60% of the $2.9 trillion industry.\n\nThat\u2019s the highest since February 2021. Bitcoin\u2019s total market value sits at $1.9 trillion.\n\n\u201cRising Bitcoin dominance typically signals a risk-off environment, where investors prioritise Bitcoin\u2019s relative stability over more speculative assets,\u201d Mike Cahill, Director of Pyth Data Association told DL News.\n\n\u201cWhen liquidity is concentrated in Bitcoin, it\u2019s often a sign of a cautious market awaiting stronger conviction in riskier assets.\u201d\n\nThis suggests that investors still hopeful of a repeat of late 2021 \u2014 or the market euphoria of DeFi summer \u2014 will be left behind.\n\nIn 2021, nearly every token rallied in what was later dubbed \u201caltseason,\u201d while Bitcoin\u2019s dominance plummeted.\n\nNowadays, only a few altcoins have a high correlation with Bitcoin, meaning the top crypto and a small subset of alternative tokens will be the big winners.\n\n\u201cSelective altseason is here,\u201d said Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, said on X on February 8. \u201cInfra coins like Ethereum are sluggish, while those tied to institutional adoption, stablecoins, and memes have survived.\u201d\n\nEven so, \u201cthe era of \u2018everything pumping\u2019 is over,\u201d Yu said.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s foothold\n\nDuring DeFi summer, which took place between mid 2021 and late 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s foothold over the total industry fell to a low of 40%.\n\nUsers piled into decentralised finance, while Bitcoin took a back seat.\n\nBut the good times would come to an end. The first warning came in 2022 with the Terra Luna collapse , which saw $40 billion wiped from the crypto ecosystem.\n\nLater in the year, Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX scandal cast a dark cloud over the industry. And in 2023, the fall of Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank deepened crypto\u2019s crater.\n\nDisillusionment\n\nThe deluge of scandals made investors rush for the exits to safer areas of the market.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have been burned by and became disillusioned with altcoins,\u201d Jameson Lopp, CTO of crypto custodian Casa, told DL News. \u201cMore people are viewing crypto as a massive casino, and either quit the space completely or switched to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nJohn Haar, managing director at Bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin, echoed that view.\n\n\u201cCrypto, which we separate from Bitcoin, has struggled to form a new narrative to sell itself,\u201d Haar told DL News.\n\nThat\u2019s because in 2022, many crypto projects \u201cwere revealed to be pushing promises of fake innovation, and instead were shown to be a mix of hype, speculation, flawed designs, and outright fraud,\u201d Haar said.\n\nEven so, Lopp signalled that memecoins are actually good for Bitcoin, even as the once-darling sector of crypto has fallen out of favour .\n\n\u201cThe proliferation of memecoins and acceleration of altcoin cycles to compress them into a half life of hours is bad for altcoin season and good for Bitcoin,\u201d he said on X on Monday.\n\nInstitutional adoption\n\nSome analysts say that institutional adoption is another of the top drivers for soaring Bitcoin dominance.\n\nSince Bitcoin exchange-traded funds went live on Wall Street in early January 2024, institutions have been devouring Bitcoin as part of sophisticated risk and arbitrage trades.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has been trading on a macro picture,\u201d compared with other cryptocurrencies, Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at research firm Amberdata told DL News.\n\nTurning tides\n\nThat said, the tides might be turning.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies have been gaining ground. Ethereum has its own ETF and a new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission under US President Donald Trump has received an onslaught of new ETF applications.\n\nLitecoin has the highest odds of approval, followed by Solana , and XRP .\n\nJPMorgan sees up to $8 billion flowing into an XRP ETF, with experts saying it could receive $800 million in its first weekend of trading.\n\nPedro Solimano is a markets correspondent based in Buenos Aires.

      "content": "Isolated Margin: If you use Rs 1,000 as your initial margin, that\u2019s also your maintenance margin. It means you\u2019re restricting the trade from accessing the remaining Rs 4,000 in your account. In case of liquidation, only the Rs 1,000 is at risk. You can manually add more margin if needed, and in the crypto market, unlike in the stock market, you don\u2019t pay extra fees for adding margin. So, in isolated margin mode, your initial margin also serves as your maintenance margin, and if liquidation occurs, you lose only the Rs 1,000.\n\nCross Margin: In this mode, you allow the trade to use the remaining Rs 4,000 in your account in case of a near liquidation event. For instance, if you\u2019re trading with 10x leverage and the market drops by 10%, there\u2019s a risk of liquidation. But with cross margin, the trade can use the additional Rs 4,000 to avoid liquidation. In this case, the maintenance margin includes the Rs 4,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, navigating market volatility can be daunting, especially for first-time investors.In an interview with ETMarkets Livestream, Sudhakar Pradhan, a member of the founding team at Pi42 , shares his deep understanding of navigating the ever-evolving crypto landscape.In this exclusive conversation, he shares beginner-friendly investment playbook, revealing valuable insights and practical tips to help newcomers confidently ride the crypto waves.Whether you're just starting or looking to refine your strategy, Pradhan\u2019s wisdom offers a guiding light through the unpredictable yet exciting world of digital assets.Bitcoin futures, or for that matter, crypto futures, work similarly to equity futures in many aspects. However, there are a couple of key differences as well.For example, similar to the equity futures, there is the concept of not owning the asset in the derivative framework. Additionally, you can benefit from leverage when trading in derivatives or futures, whether in stocks or crypto.But there are a few key differences here. For example, in stocks, you get very limited leverage, maybe 5x or 10x. In crypto, however, it can go beyond 100x. Even if you talk about Pi42 itself, we offer around 75x leverage.Another difference is the trading hours. In stock futures, trading is limited, for example, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., depending on the exchange timing. In crypto, trading is available 24x7, including weekends, which is a significant difference.The third and very interesting difference is the expiry. In stock futures, there is an expiry date attached to the contract. However, in crypto, primarily \u2013 not all, but primarily \u2013 they are perpetual futures. This means the contract never expires, and you can hold it for an indefinite number of days. So, yes, these are the key differences between crypto futures and stock futures.This is also quite interesting. For example, in stock or equity futures, the position size must be a multiple of the asset value. For instance, if you pick a stock with a market price of Rs 1,000, you must trade in multiples of Rs 1,000.However, in crypto futures, you can hold a fraction of an asset. For example, the price of Bitcoin in INR is around 88.6 lakh, close to ninety lakhs. But on our platform, you can hold a 0.02 contract size of Bitcoin, which would be around Rs 17,000 to Rs 18,000. This is quite interesting because you don\u2019t have to hold the entire asset; you can have just a fraction of it. This is a primary difference.Another difference is the expiration date. As I mentioned earlier, Bitcoin or crypto futures are primarily perpetual in nature. However, some crypto futures, like CME Bitcoin futures, are similar to traditional futures and have an expiry date. But generally, in the crypto segment, perpetual futures are more popular.While there is no expiry date for perpetual futures, there is a funding fee attached to maintain the price with the spot market.Regarding the settlement method, it is very fast \u2013 I would even say instant. On any exchange, whether a centralized exchange like Binance or a decentralized exchange, if you close your trade, the settlement is processed immediately.Yes, that\u2019s completely true. I\u2019ll start with how leverage works in crypto futures. It\u2019s quite similar to stock futures. It\u2019s very interesting compared to the spot market because, in the spot market, you don\u2019t get leverage. Leverage means, for example, if you have Rs 1,000 as margin\u2014that\u2019s your capital\u2014and you want to trade with 10x leverage, it means you can take a position worth Rs 10,000. But you\u2019re only putting up Rs 1,000 as a margin. That\u2019s the basic concept of leverage. As I mentioned, in the equity market, you might get 5x or 10x leverage. So, with Rs 1,000 as capital, you could take a trade worth Rs 5,000 or Rs 10,000.But in crypto, you can go much higher\u201450x, 70x, or even 75x. For example, with Rs 1,000 as a margin, you could take a position worth up to Rs 75,000 on Pi42. That\u2019s a unique feature.As you pointed out, different cryptocurrencies have different leverage ratios. For instance, tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have substantial market caps and are relatively less volatile compared to meme coins or newly introduced coins. We conduct a stringent analysis of these pairs. If they are popular and not highly volatile, we offer higher leverage, like 50x or 75x. On the other hand, for highly volatile or new coins, we keep the leverage lower\u2014around 10x, 15x, or 20x.Regarding the 10:1 leverage ratio, as I mentioned, if you put Rs 1,000 as the margin, you can take a position worth Rs 10,000.There are two aspects to this. First, the margin requirement, including the maintenance margin. The initial margin is the amount you need to start the trade. For example, if I have Rs 5,000 in my trading account and I start a trade with Rs 1,000, that\u2019s my initial margin.On Pi42, or generally in crypto trading, there are two types of margin setups: Isolated Margin and Cross Margin.So, the key difference is that in isolated margin, the risk is limited to your initial margin, while in cross margin, your entire account balance can be used to maintain the trade.If you allow me to share my screen, I can show a very interesting thing here. There are three differences between marking to market in stocks and in crypto. For example, in equity trading, at the end of the day, you get an update on your position and your marking to market. However, in crypto, you get real-time updates. For instance, as I mentioned, you can hold a position size of fractions like 0.002, which is worth around 17,000, and go long with 10x leverage. In that case, you can see the unrealized P&L, the margin ratio, and the liquidation price in real-time. Basically, in the crypto market, you receive real-time updates about your position size, marking to market, and unrealized profit. You can directly book a profit or loss. In contrast, the stock market operates differently.Similar to the equity market, there is a big difference between spot and futures trading. The primary difference is leverage. In the spot market, you buy multiples of the price and pay the full price. However, in futures, you pay a fraction of the asset and own a larger position. Another key difference is that in the spot market, you cannot go short. For example, if a stock's price is Rs 1,000 and you are holding it, you cannot benefit if the price goes down. But in futures, whether in equity or crypto, you can go short. You can buy at Rs 1,000 and sell at Rs 1,200, or vice versa\u2014you can sell at Rs 1,000 and then buy at Rs 800, making a profit even when the market goes down.I would like to add an interesting point here, especially in crypto. In India, there is a VDA (Virtual Digital Asset) tax. If you are trading in the spot market, you are actually buying the asset and thus owning the VDA, so you must pay taxes according to Indian law. In futures, however, you are merely trading contracts without actual buying or selling of the asset. As you do not own VDAs, you are not required to pay VDA taxes, which is quite interesting.It is similar to the stock market when using leverage. For example, if I am using 10x leverage and the market goes up by 10% in my favor, I would get a 100% profit. On the other case, if it goes down by 10%, I would lose all my money. In that case, if I am using isolated margin and not adding any more TPSL (Take Profit Stop Loss) or not adding any margin when the position is getting liquidated.Yes. Then, it will get liquidated.Automatically. If you are not adding any margin or TPSL, then it will hit the liquidation.There are a couple of interesting things. One, as you just mentioned, is TPSL. You can set your SL (Stop Loss) limits so that if your trade is not going in your direction, it will hit the SL, ensuring safety. Particularly for new traders, using an isolated margin helps protect the rest of the money in your wallet.The third tool is hedging, which is quite interesting in futures trading. We have two markets: one is the INR market, and the other is the USDT market. These are for the same contracts. For example, the BTC-INR contract is traded in INR. Similarly, the same contract can be traded in the BTC-USDT market.Here\u2019s how hedging works: In one trade, you can go long in the USDT market and go short in the INR market for the same pair, BTC-INR. If the long position gains, you can close the loss-making orders in the other market. You can also add more margin or adjust the leverage during the trade if you are confident that the market will move in your favor. This approach helps minimize risk.Yes, there are a lot of indicators available. People can check them out on our portal. Apart from stop loss and hedging, traders can also use position sizing. As I mentioned, if you are using isolated margin, you don\u2019t have to use 100% of your available capital. You can use 25% or whatever percentage you are comfortable with.Another strategy is diversification because there are tons of pairs available. On Pi42 itself, we have over 250 pairs in each market, so cumulatively, it\u2019s more than 550 pairs. Depending on your research and your comfort level in picking a particular coin or pair, you can diversify your trades to minimize risk.This is very interesting. As I mentioned earlier, compared to the stock market, the crypto market is very lucrative for many because of its volatility. And they say - volatility is the friend of a trader.Exactly. Market volatility is much higher in crypto compared to the stock market, and this is why many people prefer trading in crypto. For example, Bitcoin is like a trillion-dollar asset, yet it can go up or down by 5% to 10%. This is a great.I can show you a couple of pairs as an example. For instance, among the top gainers, Virtual Protocol is one of the leading AI projects, and it is up by 23% in the last 24 hours. Today, the market is generally up, so you might not see many drastic changes, but some meme coins are performing better or showing bigger differences. Some are up by 46% or 38%, but yes, Virtual Protocol, which is a mainstream AI token, is still showing a 23% increase.In crypto, you can trade 24x7. You see more volume when the bigger, more mature markets like the US and Europe are active. During these times, there is a lot of volume, and many micro and macroeconomic events happen during US trading hours. If you are in India, you might miss out on these opportunities because it\u2019s usually nighttime here.In such situations, you can use bots, specifically API trading. It might sound complex to new traders, but I would say APIs are very easy because we provide API documentation with basic code. As a trader, you can learn how to tweak the basic logic, such as when to buy or sell. For example, if BTC is around 8,60,000, you can set parameters for when to buy, when to add TPSL (Take Profit Stop Loss), when to sell, or when to rebuy.You can make minor adjustments to these settings and implement your trade accordingly. And yes, we do provide that. For example, instead of manually executing a trade, it will happen automatically. You can also add multiple coins or single coins, depending on your preference.From an Indian trader\u2019s perspective, before checking liquidity and other aspects, you should definitely check if the platform is FIU compliant. FIU stands for the Financial Intelligence Unit, which is India\u2019s government body that doesn\u2019t regulate but monitors the crypto market in India.You should check if the exchange is FIU registered. This is the primary consideration in India. Even foreign exchanges like Binance and others must register with the FIU to operate in India.After confirming FIU compliance, the next thing to consider is liquidity. As a trader, you want good liquidity to buy and sell at favorable prices and avoid slippage.Other important factors include the variety of coins available. For example, we have over 500 pairs. This variety is essential because not all coins perform the same way. Bitcoin might move 10% or 12% one day but go sideways on another day. In such cases, you can trade other tokens that are performing well.Additionally, look for better tools, such as advanced bot trading features, better indicators, and a more efficient trading chart interface.Lastly, security is crucial, especially for your funds. I\u2019d like to highlight that we provide INR margin trading. This means that, as an Indian trader, you can deposit fiat currency (INR) and trade directly without converting it to USDT. Your funds are stored in Indian banks, unlike other exchanges where funds are kept in digital wallets. This provides an added layer of security.Other factors to consider include customer support, user feedback, and ratings on platforms like the Play Store or Google.Pretty interesting. It\u2019s a new concept, I would say. A couple of years back, in 2022, the Indian government introduced VDA taxes. After that, here\u2019s what happened: In the case of spot trading or even futures, they introduced a 1% TDS on each transaction and a flat 30% VDA tax. Also, you cannot set off your losses.For spot trading, all these taxes are applicable. However, in the case of futures, these taxes are only applicable during off-ramping or on-ramping, not on each trade since it\u2019s a derivative. Off-ramping and on-ramping refer to converting your fiat to crypto (like USDT) and then converting your USDT back to INR. In such cases, you have to pay those taxes because VDA is involved.However, with INR margin, you don\u2019t have to do that. There are a couple of advantages. First, you can save a lot of money on conversion fees. In the traditional method, you would first convert your INR to USDT and pay a conversion fee, then again pay a conversion fee when converting USDT back to INR. With INR margin, you eliminate these conversion fees.Secondly, as I mentioned, you can directly trade with the INR margin, which helps you optimize your VDA taxes since you don\u2019t have to pay them. It falls under business income, so you can pay taxes according to your income slab.There are a couple of things to consider. As I mentioned, we have tons of indicators that people can use for technical analysis. I\u2019ll start with the basics.For example, RSI (Relative Strength Index) is one indicator. It shows the overall sentiment of the market. If it is above 70, it is considered overbought, and if it goes below 30, it is oversold.I also mentioned that emerging markets follow mature markets like the US. Any event happening there, such as CPI data, PPI data, elections, or any macro and microeconomic events related to the crypto domain, can influence the market. Even if some projects announce significant launches or partnerships with big companies like Nvidia, those events can impact prices.You can track these events and trade accordingly. Additionally, indicators like RSI can be useful. Another indicator is VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price), which indicates the average price. If the price is below the VWAP, it might be a good entry point.There are multiple factors to consider, and it\u2019s not necessary to follow just one principle.",

      "title": "Major Crypto Scam Exposed: Mumbai and Hyderabad Police Take Action Against COINZX Fraud",
      "content": "Past allegations and expanding investigation\n\nHYDERABAD: The cryptocurrency fraud involving COINZX , a firm with alleged Dubai links, has widened, with the Mumbai police now booking a case following an earlier case with Hyderabad Central Crime Station. Investigators estimate the total scam amount could reach Rs 200 crore.Hyderabad Central Crime Station (CCS) police previously arrested Ravi Mahaseth, the managing director of COINZX, in connection with the case. A Hyderabad Sessions Court later granted him bail. His associate, Ramesh Puri, was also arrested and is currently lodged in Hyderabad jail.A week ago, the Kasturba Marg police in Mumbai registered a case against Mahaseth and five others for allegedly deceiving investors into putting money into a cryptocurrency launched by COINZX.According to the complainant in Mumbai, multiple meetings were held where he and other investors were persuaded to invest large sums in COINZX. The company marketed itself as \"India's Bitcoin\" and presented high returns on investment, gaining investors' trust by claiming to have the backing of Mahaseth's large forex trading business.Hyderabad Case and Court ProceedingsThe first complaint against COINZX in Hyderabad was filed on February 11 by Jitender Puri, a resident of Goshamahal, who claimed he lost Rs 5 lakh. Several investors in Hyderabad collectively invested around Rs 2 crore.Police alleged that Mahaseth and his associates induced victims to invest in COINZX, only for them to later realise that the company ceased operations. A case was booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Telangana State Depositors Act.Mahaseth, a 40-year-old resident of Malad East, Mumbai, was granted bail by a Hyderabad Sessions Court on February 24. He claimed his arrest was illegal and that he was not informed of the grounds of arrest, nor was his family notified. The prosecution refuted these claims, stating that the arrest was conducted lawfully and his family was informed via telephone, although no call records were provided to substantiate this.Mahaseth also cited health concerns, stating he recently underwent open-heart surgery and was subsequently admitted to Gandhi Hospital. The court, considering his medical condition, granted bail on the condition that he would not leave the jurisdiction of Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy districts without prior permission, would cooperate with the investigation, and would not tamper with witnesses. He is required to report to the CCS, Hyderabad, on the second and fourth Saturday of every month until the charge sheet is filed.Additionally, once his health condition improves and he is discharged from the hospital, Mahaseth must surrender to the investigating officials for five days of police custody to assist in the probe. The prosecution sought police custody, but the court deferred the request due to his medical state.Investigators have linked Mahaseth to other investment firms, including FX & Smart Bull, Smart X, and Samruddhi Multi Trade Pvt Ltd, which are suspected of running similar fraudulent schemes. The earliest known case against COINZX was registered in January 2023 when a victim alleged he invested $500 after attending a seminar on multi-level marketing.With cases now booked in both Hyderabad and Mumbai, law enforcement agencies are expanding their probe. Hyderabad police informed Mumbai cops regarding the arrest of the accused.",

      "content": "Crypto struggles\n\nFaded hopes for crypto-friendly policies\n\nA risky asset\n\nFall of \u201cTRUMP\u201d and \u201cMELANIA\u201d tokens\n\nBybit hack\n\nThe end of the crypto hype?\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is experiencing a vicious sell-off, with more than $810 billion erased from its overall worth, as per a report.In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has dipped 6.40%, which is a year-to-date decline of 14.69%, reported Coinpedia. While Ethereum fell 9.52% and Solana dropped 8.52% in a single day, the report added.Here are the reasons that have contributed to this enormous meltdown.Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index, explained that \u201cInflationary pressures, growth prospects are crumbling and Trump\u2019s tariffs are not going away. And with Trump\u2019s attention on anything except deregulating crypto, bitcoin traders are not happy,\u201d as quoted by Tech Central.Just a few weeks ago, bitcoin surged on hopes that the Trump administration would ease crypto regulations. But that optimism has fizzled as promises for policy changes have not materialized, leaving many investors feeling uncertain.Joshua Chu, co-chair of the Hong Kong Web3 Association, said that \" bitcoin price decline shows that positive sentiments from a crypto-friendly administration and high-profile endorsements have run their course\u201d, as quoted in the report. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s clear bitcoin is a risk asset, not the inflation hedge or digital gold it\u2019s often touted to be,\u201d quoted Tech Central.Even Trump's latest tariffs triggered a broader pullback from risk assets, including crypto, reported GuruFocus.Trump\u2019s own memecoin \u201cTRUMP\u201d has lost 50% of its value since its launch, while his wife\u2019s token \u201cMELANIA\u201d dropped 90%, reported Tech Central.The crypto community is on edge after Bybit, the world\u2019s second-largest exchange, reported that hackers stole about $1.5 billion worth of ether in what is being called the biggest crypto heist ever, as per the report.According to Tech Central, investors are pulling back from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with $2.27 billion in outflows just this week. Bank of America analysts noted that Bitcoin\u2019s struggle to break above $97,000 since November is a clear sign that the \u201cbro bubble\u201d around crypto might be bursting, as per the report.Over the past couple of years, much of the crypto hype was driven by young, social media-savvy influencers and tech entrepreneurs, often referred to as \u201ccrypto bros,\u201d but now that enthusiasm seems to be fading, as per Tech Central.According to GuruFocus, \"institutional players are scaling back, recalibrating expectations, and waiting for real policy moves before making their next big bet.\"The market is experiencing a major sell-off, with over $810 billion wiped out. A mix of inflation concerns, ongoing tariffs, regulatory uncertainty, and major hacks like the Bybit breach have shaken investor confidence.Trump\u2019s memecoin \u201cTRUMP\u201d has lost 50% of its value, while the \u201cMELANIA\u201d token dropped by 90%.",

      "title": "Building trust in the crypto industry should be a shared responsibility",
      "content": "ET CONTRIBUTORS\n\nInnovation is not a one-time wonder. It needs persistence to keep the wheels in motion. One reason India has come to become the world\u2019s leader in IT & ITES is that the government has focused on skill development and enabled policies, helping local players grow. These efforts have contributed to the establishment of prominent companies, increased foreign direct investment, and created numerous job opportunities. The government was remarkably proactive in achieving that feat.After over three decades of the IT boom, when an interest seems to be growing towards cryptocurrency, Indians await similar policy interventions to regularise the sector and bring in more incentives to bolster the industry. WazirX , a cryptocurrency exchange platform established in 2018, quickly rose to prominence in India's rising cryptocurrency market. The platform made crypto a popular investment choice. Despite facing regulatory hurdles and market volatility, the company has been able to maintain its position as one of India's top crypto exchanges.However, on July 18, 2024, the platform suffered a $230 million cyber-attack perpetrated by North Korean hackers This breach significantly impacted user sentiment in the crypto ecosystem. Regardless, the platform is undergoing a restructuring under the High Court of Singapore, and is set to distribute almost 85% worth of user funds from the time of the cyber-attack in April, less than a year after the incident.As new technologies integrate into the economic landscape, there is a need for reassessing the nation\u2019s existing risk management frameworks. The first step in this process is a deeper understanding of risks associated with emerging technologies. A flexible risk management strategy developed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance will be essential to navigate these complexities in crypto which merges the best of both tech and finance and focusses on creating value based on a digital ledger.But what makes it so urgent is the array of risks that is lurking in the geopolitical space that has come under the radar of national security agencies across the world. Proper regulatory intervention would mean that a thorough analysis of international security risks is conducted.WazirX is on the brink of bouncing back from a massive setback with its restructuring scheme approved by the Singapore courts. The proposed scheme involves an initial distribution of 85% users\u2019 investment in April 2025, to be made in crypto. This could be one of the fastest in the industry. In comparison, the Mt. Gox case has taken 10 years, while the FTX case has taken more than 3 years to resolve. The alternative to this scheme is liquidation, which is a bad option as it substantially increases costs and the time taken, potentially up to five years, with the distribution being made in fiat currency ( USD ). Voting for the scheme makes it the obvious choice for WazirX users.This incident also raises pertinent questions about the future of crypto regulation. Crypto platforms have been advocating for formal regulations in the industry to bring in method and structure, and avoid legal penalties resulting from ambiguity of existing terms. The absence of such regulations has forced many crypto companies to self-regulate.When it comes to assets like crypto, investors might find it risky but they don\u2019t want to be left out of the global adoption race. India\u2019s growing presence in the global crypto market owes much to domestic platforms. Policies need to be created in collaboration with domestic companies to showcase real use cases and cyber protocols.Domestic crypto players can play a pivotal role in positioning India as a global leader in digital assets, especially as the cryptocurrency landscape evolves. Lately there have been significant international shifts, as the one underway in the U.S. with President Trump's pro-crypto stance fuelling massive crypto adoption, encouraging institutional and retail investors to increase their participation. To match up, India must leverage the strengths of local platforms to create a conducive environment for both retail and institutional investors.India needs to foster collaboration between regulatory bodies and the private sector to build a more dynamic and forward-thinking approach. A bi-annual forensic investigation to assist crypto platforms must be commissioned by regulatory authorities to keep track of KYC norms, security upgrades, and a relief trust which protects the companies and its users in case of vulnerabilities arising due to force majeure events.There should also be a contingency plan that is created in partnership with think tanks and financial institutions that offers a recovery roadmap along with insurance cover up to a certain amount. Regular assessments of investor risk appetite, informed by real-time data and market trends, would enable identification of risks early and adjust safeguards accordingly.Ultimately, India\u2019s policy approach should be characterized by agility, foresight, and inclusivity so it can better safeguard the industry while promoting innovation. India exchanges can help in facilitating initiatives like Bitcoin reserves that the USA is undertaking. Platforms with high liquidity can enable institutions to buy and sell Bitcoin quickly at competitive prices. Crypto exchanges can also help Indian institutions diversify their reserves by offering a range of crypto assets.An assurance should be provided by regulators where laws they introduce are neither too stringent, nor too lenient, so as to make sure all stakeholders are compliant, but no new prospects are stifled. The government must act on safeguarding companies which are bold enough to set foot in emerging technologies, as opposed to just urging investors to exercise caution. Private players have always been key in enabling tech adoption for the Indian government. When it comes to leveraging home-grown businesses to shape reforms, sky's the limit.",

      "title": "XRP News Today: SEC to Drop Ripple Appeal After Closed-Door Meeting? New BTC L2 Project StratoVM Grabs Attention by Whales",
      "content": "In a recent update on X, John Reed Stark, who previously worked as an enforcement attorney for the SEC, shared a prediction about the Ripple Labs litigation. According to Stark, there are signs that the SEC might be considering abandoning its legal pursuit against Ripple \u2013 we\u2019ll cover this in detail below.\n\nA new project that might be worth monitoring as well is StratoVM ($SVM), which presents a Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin that could enable smart contract functionality, meme token creation, and decentralized finance applications directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAfter an impressive price surge of over 2300% within a single month and with its mainnet release on the horizon, StratoVM could revolutionize how Bitcoin holders utilize their assets.\n\nLet\u2019s check out the deets.\n\nXRP Latest News: Will the SEC Drop the Ripple Appeal Soon? Here\u2019s What Analysts Believe Will Happen\n\nAccording to Stark, recent developments within the regulatory agency suggest the SEC might abandon its appeal against Ripple. During the previous administration, Gary Gensler issued Wells Notices to Robinhood, Uniswap, and OpenSea, consistently advocating for tighter regulatory control over cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, the SEC has now terminated its investigation into Robinhood Crypto. The commission announced it would not pursue further action following the Wells Notice delivered to Robinhood in May 2024. The former SEC enforcement attorney suggests this trend points to the possibility that the SEC's appeal against Ripple Labs could be discontinued as well.\n\nIn a related social media post, legal specialist Fred Rispoli addressed concerns about the XRP lawsuit's complexity, contending that the resolution is straightforward and forthcoming.\n\nRispoli characterized the SEC's justifications as \"cowardly\" and dismissed concerns regarding the absence of new SEC Chair Paul Atkins and Judge Analisa Torres' $125 million penalty against Ripple as unfounded. He remains optimistic that a settlement in the lawsuit is imminent.\n\nBitcoin's DeFi Revolution? StratoVM Is a New L2 Platform That Could Bring Major Upgrades\n\nStratoVM ($SVM) is building a Layer-2 solution that could bring smart contracts, meme coins, AI, and DeFi applications to the Bitcoin network.\n\nCurrently priced at $0.068, $SVM has seen an astonishing 2,700% increase in just a week, according to CoinGecko. This surge suggests early adopters may believe in its ability to address Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing scalability challenges, even in a declining market.\n\nSVM 30-day chart, Source: CoinGecko\n\nWith its mainnet launch on the horizon, StratoVM could be approaching a major inflection point. Compared to CoreDAO\u2014a Bitcoin Layer-2 valued at $990 million\u2014StratoVM\u2019s $3 million valuation may hint at a potential upside if expectations around its development are met.\n\nThe BTCFi sector is experiencing rapid growth, with DeFiLlama reporting an increase in total value locked from $307 million in January 2024 to $6.6 billion by February 2025. StratoVM\u2019s specific approach might position it as a key project in this expanding market.\n\nA recent Uniswap listing may further enhance its credibility, and its ecosystem\u2014backed by 50+ strategic partners\u2014could help bring adoption.\n\nAdding to the excitement, speculation about an upcoming centralized exchange (CEX) listing is circulating. If true, this move could drive further attention and price momentum. Meanwhile, the project\u2019s community is scaling fast, surpassing 110,000 followers across X, Telegram, and Discord.\n\nAs Bitcoin transitions beyond its role as a store of value, StratoVM\u2019s focus on scalability and security could make it a strong contender in the Bitcoin DeFi space. Its testnet is already showing promise, with over 113,312 wallets registered and more than 56,200 daily transactions processed.\n\nIf StratoVM successfully rolls out its intended features, it might open up new possibilities for Bitcoin holders\u2014potentially making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for DeFi applications.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIf the SEC drops its case against Ripple, it could mark a major shift in regulatory attitudes toward crypto, potentially paving the way for broader industry growth.\n\nAt the same time, projects like StratoVM ($SVM) could push the boundaries of what Bitcoin can do, potentially bringing DeFi, smart contracts, and scalability solutions to the network. As its mainnet launch nears and speculation around major exchange listings grows, StratoVM could generate serious buzz with its features.\n\nThis article does not offer financial advice.

      "content": "\n\n\n\nSINGAPORE, Feb. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With Bitcoin's price fluctuating below $100,000, many analysts predict a prolonged period of high volatility in the crypto market. Holding spot positions may struggle to generate short-term profits in such conditions. As a result, 100x leverage futures trading has become the preferred tool for seasoned investors looking to maximize potential gains in this volatile market. BexBack Exchange is ramping up its efforts to offer traders unmatched promotional packages.The platform now offers a 100% deposit bonus , a $50 welcome bonus for new users, and up to 100x leverage on cryptocurrency trading, providing excellent opportunities for investors.\n\nWhat Is 100x Leverage and How Does It Work?\n\nSimply put, 100x leverage allows you to open larger trading positions with less capital. For example:\n\nSuppose the Bitcoin price is $100,000 that day, and you open a long contract with 1 BTC. After using 100x leverage, the transaction amount is equivalent to 100 BTC.\n\nOne day later, if the price rises to $105,000, your profit will be (105,000 - 100,000) * 100 BTC / 100,000 = 5 BTC, a yield of up to 500%.\n\nWith BexBack's deposit bonus\n\n\n\n\n\nBexBack offers a 100% deposit bonus . If the initial investment is 2 BTC, the profit will increase to 10 BTC, and the return on investment will double to 1000%.\n\nNote: Although leveraged trading can magnify profits, you also need to be wary of liquidation risks.\n\nHow Does the 100% Deposit Bonus Work?\n\nThe deposit bonus from BexBack cannot be directly withdrawn but can be used to open larger positions and increase potential profits. Additionally, during significant market fluctuations, the bonus can serve as extra margin, effectively reducing the risk of liquidation.\n\nAbout BexBack?\n\nBexBack is a leading cryptocurrency derivatives platform that offers 100x leverage on BTC, ETH, ADA, SOL, XRP, and 50 other major cryptocurrencies for futures contracts..

      "content": "Today in crypto, global trade concerns continue pressuring investor sentiment, risking a potential Bitcoin correction below the key $75,000 support level, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released a statement saying it does not view memecoins as securities as it drops its lawsuits against Coinbase, Consensys and Gemini.\n\nBitcoin risks deeper drop if $75K support fails amid macro concerns\n\nBitcoin risks more downside if it loses a \u201ckey\u201d $75,000 support amid growing concerns over a potential trade war between the United States and China.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s BTCUSD price has fallen more than 6.5% during the past 24 hours to sink below a low of $78,197, which was last seen on Nov. 10, 2024, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.\n\nAnalysts attribute the current decline to macroeconomic concerns related to a potential trade war between the US and China caused by US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose import tariffs.\n\nThese macroeconomic concerns were the main reason for Bitcoin losing the $80,000 support, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.\n\nThe analyst told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s drop below $80,000 amid investor fear from Trump\u2019s tariffs and market unrest, points to a correction likely hitting $76,000-$78,000 this week, nearing $75,000 as a key support level based on historical patterns and trader sentiment.\u201d\n\nStill, some analysts are concerned that Bitcoin\u2019s correction may see the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency revisit $70,000.\n\nBased on its correlation with the global liquidity index, Bitcoin\u2019s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price someone is willing to sell the currency for, may fall below $70,000 around the end of February, after it peaked near $110,000 in January.\n\nSEC says memecoins aren\u2019t securities, but fraud will still be policed\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission says it does not view memecoins as securities but warned any fraudulent tokens could still be subject to enforcement actions by other regulators.\n\nThe agency\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance said in a Feb. 27 statement that, in its view, memecoins \u201cdo not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws\u201d and \u201care akin to collectibles.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,\u201d the SEC said.\n\nIt added that memecoin buyers and holders wouldn\u2019t be protected by US securities laws but said the fraudulent offer and sale of memecoins \u201cmay be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies.\u201d\n\nSEC agrees to drop Consensys lawsuit\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has agreed in principle to drop its lawsuit against crypto firm Consensys \u2014 the developer of MetaMask. The suit claimed that aspects of MetaMask violated securities laws.\n\nAccording to Ethereum co-founder and Consensys founder Joseph Lubin, the SEC has agreed to file a motion effectively ending the case, and the conclusion of the litigation is still subject to final approval from the commission. Lubin added:\n\n\u201cNow we can get 100% back to building. 2025 is going to be the best year yet for Ethereum and Consensys. The paradigm shift to a much more decentralized world is accelerating.\u201d\n\nConsensys attorney Bill Hughes told Cointelegraph that the agreement to drop litigation was fairly straightforward and that the SEC would not impose any fines or conditions on Consensys as part of the lawsuit dismissal.\n\n\u201cThe litigation team on their side understood that the SEC was going to be moving in a new direction,\u201d Hughes said and attributed the federal agency\u2019s regulatory pivot to a change in leadership and the pro-crypto policies of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThere was definitely a tenor change in the conversations post-election,\u201d between Consensys and the SEC, the attorney added.\n\nConsensys was sued by the SEC in June 2024. The agency alleged that the company made more than $250 million in fees by offering staking services and digital asset swaps through MetaMask.\n\nRelated: SEC dismisses lawsuit against Coinbase",
