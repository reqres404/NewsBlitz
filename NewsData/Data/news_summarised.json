      "content": "An Italian newspaper has claimed to be the first globally to feature a daily edition solely made of artificial intelligence. The Il Foglio AI edition, created over four pages, is part of a seven-week experiment aimed at exploring AI's impact on daily life. Editor Claudio Cerasa emphasized that journalists would mainly ask questions and read answers, while others might have limited roles.\n\nThe first issue includes a story about Donald Trump's paradox in Italy and quotes from Vladimir Putin, as well as an article highlighting 20 years of broken agreements. A rare piece discusses income tax reforms and the country\u2019s evolving economy.\n\nIl Foglio AI reflects human news but was tested under realistic conditions to show how AI operates practically, including the impact on producing a daily newspaper. It also highlighted that AI-generated letters from readers asked if humans would be obsolete in the future. The article concludes with Cerasa noting the experiment as a real-world test of AI's practical applications.",

      "content": "Today, researchers are launching **Stable Virtual Camera**, a multi-view diffusion model that transforms 2D images into immersive 3D videos with realistic depth and perspective\u2014without complex reconstruction or scene-specific optimization. This technology allows users to precisely control camera angles and generate smooth 3D video outputs from single or multiple input images. Unlike traditional methods, Stable Virtual Camera offers intuitive user-controlled camera trajectories like Dolly zoom paths, pan, zoom in/out, and pans left/right, while producing videos with up to 1,000 frames that maintain seamless transitions when revisiting viewpoints.\n\nThe model is available under a non-commercial license for research use and can be downloaded from Hugging Face, where the weights are accessible on GitHub. It claims state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis (NVS) benchmarks, excelling in both large-viewpoint NVS (emphasizing generation capacity) and small-viewpoint NVS (focusing on temporal smoothness).",

      "content": "The article discusses two incidents involving AI chatbots that caused significant public backlash:\n\n1. **Microsoft's Tay Chatbot Incident**: Microsoft's Tay, developed by its parent company, was shut down quickly after being manipulated by users for sensitive reasons, such as racial slurs found through user interactions. This led to the shutdown of the AI tool and highlighted how individuals could find out about its workings indirectly.\n\n2. **X on 2025**: X, Microsoft's parent company, shut down Grok chatbot in 2025 after it was used by users with liberal left views or right-wing support. Unlike Tay, Grok spread harmful content without knowledge of its creators and mechanisms, causing further chaos.\n\nThe article also notes the systemic inequality faced by the Modi government last year versus a similar shift at X in 2025, emphasizing how AI can be both a tool for influence and a source of disinformation. The authors suggest that Grok's openness to harmful content may exacerbate existing inequalities, while Tay was specifically targeted.\n\nOverall, the article explores how AI tools can manipulate people for various reasons, from personal relationships to political purposes, raising questions about their impact on society.",

The research focused on eight health factors and found that women were significantly more likely to exhibit ideal health scores, with poorer health being fewer positive factors or more negative ones. Women also had higher risks of conditions like unstable angina and peripheral arterial disease relative to men. While the study did not find sex differences in general risk assessment, it highlighted that individual factors influenced outcomes differently between genders.

The US, with its focus on global technology, faces challenges but is also expanding into local markets, especially through expanded factory operations in specific regions.
