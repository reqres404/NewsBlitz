      "content": "World Health Day 2025 is officially announced as \"Healthy beginnings, hopeful futures,\" focusing on improving maternal and newborn health. The initiative emphasizes the significance of this year as a crucial moment to help families and showcase progress while highlighting research for better women's lives. Globally, over 300,000 maternal deaths occur each year, with nearly 2 million births and around 2 million stillborn worldwide. Most losses are in low-income countries, those affected by conflict, or facing crises. Health facilities closing pose risks to pregnant women accessing essential services. Current funding constraints slow progress, as many critical health programs stall alongside medical research. The campaign will run until 2026, urging investments in proven interventions like improved pregnancy care and access. It also aims to address health issues beyond maternal complications, including mental health and nutrition. Every dollar invested is expected to yield $9-$20 back. Women need paid leave, vital family planning, research for better care, support during emergencies, and strengthening healthcare worker roles. In low-income countries, investments yield significant returns. The campaign aims to move beyond saving lives to prioritize women's well-being, with a focus on maternal and newborn health.",
