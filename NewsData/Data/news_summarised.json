      "content": "Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, emphasized that AI will lead to job losses but argued against their widespread impact. He stated many systems marketed as AI are traditional programming rather than genuine AI. True AI uses machine learning for predictions and deep learning for creating more complex programs or conditions through unsupervised algorithms. Murthy highlighted that most current AI is outdated and trivial, focusing on supervised learning with labeled data. Deep learning, using unsupervised algorithms and neural networks, offers better potential for human-like capabilities. Despite job losses, he encouraged entrepreneurs to generate thousands of jobs through practical applications, addressing poverty.",

      "content": "A new study reveals that aspirin may help prevent cancer by interfering with platelets' protective functions. By slowing immune cells from attacking cancer cells, platelets create a shield, reducing their chance to escape detection. Clinical trials on mice suggest this effect could be seen in humans too. While aspirin doesn\u2019t cure cancer but lowers risk and offers some benefit, future research may identify biomarkers to target more effectively. Researchers also explore targeted therapies that minimize side effects. This breakthrough might pave the way for innovative treatments in the future.",

      "content": "Tanya Chawla, a biohacker, shares an intriguing method to assess acidity using a one-minute test. By adding baking soda (an alkali) and water to an empty stomach, anyone can observe if they burp. This test indicates low stomach acid due to food remaining undigested in the gut, leading to fermentation and acid reflux. Chawla challenges the common misconception that excessive stomach acid causes acid-reflex disease, instead proposing a more nuanced approach through nutritionist Balaji's method. She emphasizes that not all digestive issues result in immediate burping, making the test unreliable. For accurate results, consulting a healthcare professional is advised, suggesting tests like the Heidelberg pH test.",

After consuming such drinks, some could develop symptoms like hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and reduced consciousness. Among 21 children in the U.K. and Ireland, severe cases were linked to glycerol exposure. Parents are concerned about high sugar intake, especially with sugary drinks introduced in 2018-2019. A higher minimum dose of glycerol per kilogram of body weight (50\u2013220 ml for toddlers) is recommended. Food safety guidelines call for stricter adherence to glycerol levels and sugar content to prevent adverse effects on children's populations.",
