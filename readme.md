## Architecture

### **Frontend: React with Vite**
The frontend of **News Blitz** is built using **React** and powered by **Vite** for fast and efficient development. It pulls news data from the backend and displays summaries in an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

### **Backend: Node.js**
The backend is built using **Node.js**, which serves the news data stored in a **JSON** file. This JSON file is generated by a Python script located in the **`newsData`** folder.

### **Scraping and Summarization: Python & DeepSeek**
The **`newsData`** folder handles the scraping and summarization of news articles. It utilizes **DeepSeek**, which runs on a private host to summarize the news content before sending it to the backend. The Python script `test_main.py` generates a JSON file that the Node.js backend serves to the React frontend.

## How It Works

1. **Scraping News**: The `test_main.py` Python script scrapes news from various sources.
2. **Summarization**: The scraped news content is sent to **DeepSeek** for summarization, turning long articles into bite-sized insights.
3. **Backend Serves Data**: The summarized news data is saved in a JSON file, which is then served to the frontend by the Node.js backend.
4. **Frontend Displays News**: The React-based frontend displays the latest, most relevant news summaries for quick reading.
